<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p>I met H. R. Knickerbocker way back in 1927 or thereabouts.
Those were the good old days. They were the days of the
Long Armistice. No one had ever heard of the Rome-Berlin Axis,
Stuka dive bombers, or the Haushofer Plan. Mr. Roosevelt was
out of politics, Mr. Churchill was a chancellor of the Exchequer,
and Mr. Lindbergh had just flown the Atlantic. We talked of such
neolithic creatures as Pilsudski of Poland and Alexander of Jugoslavia,
and most of us thought that Hitler was a bad Austrian joke,
more or less. Those were the good old days. Even so, thunderheads
were gathering.</p>

<p>I first met Mr. Knickerbocker in Berlin. This was fitting, since
Berlin was his bailiwick. We all had bailiwicks in those days.
Duranty was in Moscow, Raymond Swing was in London, and
Dorothy Thompson had just left Berlin. I was bouncing all over
the place. I didn’t have my bailiwick yet. We were all very good
friends. We formed a kind of fluid international community. We
were buzzards in every foreign office, and kings on every wagon-lit.</p>

<p>We didn’t meet often, since we lived in different cities, and it
took something of a catastrophe to bring us all together. When we
did meet, the vault of heaven shook. I remember days&mdash;and nights&mdash;in
Geneva, Bucharest, Cairo, Helsingfors. I think of Sheean, the
Mowrers, Webb Miller, Shirer, Jay Allen, Fodor, Whitaker, and
many more. Don’t let me sound nostalgic. I am thinking merely
that we have all grown up. We are not cameras any longer.</p>

<p>This foreword is not about Mr. Knickerbocker’s book. Let that
speak for itself. Knick is the most pertinacious, plausible, and inquisitive
question-asker I ever met. In this book he answers questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
instead of asking them. I like to see the tables turned. I don’t
know that I agree with all his answers. But let him answer them.</p>

<p>This foreword is about Mr. Knickerbocker himself. His flaming
red hair, his flaming red personality (I mean “red” chromatically,
not politically) are famous on four continents. He needs no introduction.
But certain nuggets of memory stay fixed in mind. I
remember the time he fed me caviar inside a baked potato, at
Horcher’s in Berlin, and I remember the time I fed him a dinner
in London that, deliberately, we planned so that it would cost
exactly five pounds. I remember the time that he took me to hear
Putzi Hanfstaengl hammer out a tornado of Wagner in the Hotel
Kaiserhof, and I remember the time I took him across the freezing
Danube, on the way to Sofia, in what was supposed to be a rowboat.
I remember week-ends on the Semmering, bad oysters in
Madrid, evenings in the Café Royal, drinks in Rome, Budapest,
and points beyond.</p>

<p>Knick’s career has been spectacular in more than one dimension.
He once set out to fly the Atlantic, as a passenger in a German
plane, long before the Lindbergh flight; he was the only correspondent
during the Ethiopian war to glimpse the front from the
air; he has had more interviews with European heads of state, I
imagine, than any other newspaper man alive.</p>

<p>Mr. Knickerbocker was born in Texas in 1898. He went to
Europe in 1923, and, a student of psychiatry at the University of
Munich, walked straight into Hitler’s Beerhall Putsch. He studied
briefly in Vienna, and then got a job in Berlin on the <cite>New York
Evening Post-Philadelphia Public Ledger</cite> foreign service. Since
then his career has been a calendar of most of the great events of
our time. He spent two years in Moscow as correspondent for the
International News Service (this was in 1924-26, when Trotsky
was declining and the N.E.P. expanding), and in 1928 took over
Dorothy Thompson’s job as chief correspondent in Berlin for the
<cite>Public Ledger</cite>. He won a Pulitzer prize for distinguished foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
correspondence&mdash;a series of articles on Russia’s Five Year Plan,
but for almost ten years Berlin was the blazing focus of his life.</p>

<p>Meantime there were trips to take. In 1933 he travelled all over
Europe for a series, “Will War Come in Europe?” for I.N.S. He
saw the death of Dollfuss in Vienna, and the burial of Hindenburg
in Germany. He met Mussolini, Masaryk, King Alexander,
King Boris, Otto Habsburg, and hosts of others. He did one series
of articles on Russia and the Baltic states, comparing living standards
under communism and capitalism, and another surveying
economic aspects of the Europe that was crumbling. Came the
war in Ethiopia in 1935, which he covered on Haile Selassie’s side.
I will never forget the agitated days in London when Knick was
accumulating the vast equipment he took along. In 1936 came the
Spanish civil war, and the next year the war in China. He saw
bombings all the way from Toledo to Nanking. He returned to
Europe to cover the Anschluss crisis and the Munich disaster; then
he dipped briefly into South America, and reached Peru. Then
Europe called again; he saw the beginning of World War II in
London and France, and in 1940 accompanied the French armies
till they collapsed, and then saw the battle of Britain at its fiercest
climax, in September.</p>

<p>But let me go back to those days in Berlin. The main point I
want to make has to do with Knickerbocker in Berlin. During the
turbulent 1930’s he was much more than a journalist covering Germany;
he was a definite public character in German political life.
After Hindenburg and Hitler, he was practically the best known
man in the country. His <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réclame</i> was fabulous, personally and
politically. Everyone knew the lithe, active, red-haired Herr Knickerbocker
(pronounce the K, please). Once a musical comedy was
named for him&mdash;supreme tribute!</p>

<p>Partly this was because he published half a dozen books in
German, compiled from the long newspaper articles he wrote,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
which appeared serially in the <cite>Vossische Zeitung</cite> or the <cite>Berliner
Tageblatt</cite>. The books were extraordinarily successful in Germany;
they introduced German readers to a new type of American journalism.
Among them were <cite>Der Rote Handel Droht!</cite>, <cite>Der Rote
Handel Lockt!</cite>, <cite>Kommt Europe Wieder Hoch?</cite>, <cite>Rote Wirtschaft
und Weisse Wohlstand!</cite>, <cite>England’s Wirtschaft und Schwarzhemden!</cite>,
<cite>Deutschland So oder So!</cite>, and <cite>Kommt Krieg in Europa?</cite></p>

<p>Knick knew practically every human being of consequence in
Germany. He explored the country from top to bottom. He
talked to Hitler, Spengler, Brüning, Goering, Goebbels. Then
Hitler came to power. At the time Knickerbocker was in the
middle of a German lecture tour that had begun in the Lessing
Hochschule in Berlin. Knick watched the Nazi revolution crushingly
obliterate all opposition. He wrote a series exposing the
Brown Terror that caused violent comment in New York as well
as Berlin. Presently he was excluded from the country. There are
hate affairs as well as love affairs. The hate affair between Hitler
and Knickerbocker is one of the most torrid in political history.</p>

<p>But this should not detract from the main point, which is that
Knick knows the real Germany, loves it, and respects it. He is a
Nazi-hater, but not a German-hater. His authority on the subject
is authentic and complete.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>There is no such thing as winning a fight without passion.
France went to war apologetically; France fought the war without
music, and so France lost. Britain went to war apologetically,
but Britain had the inestimable advantage of being bombed, and
today for the first time in 100 years Britain is angry and is fighting
as she has never fought before. We, the United States, are today
apologetic, so sorry that it seems we after all are called upon to
fight, and some of us still say we should not fight, and others say
we must fight only with aviators and sailors, and never with infantrymen,
and very few indeed are the strains of martial music
throughout the land. From all sides we are called upon to restrain
our emotions, and it is said that the cool head is the shrewd head,
and that is correct, of course, but a cool head without a hot heart
is useless on a battlefield. Without anger there can be no victory
and useful anger is based upon understanding. Unless the American
people can be brought to understand that our national existence
and our individual security are today in peril, and unless the American
people become angry at the enemy, we shall become a part
of Hitler’s Reich.</p>

<p>History may eventually record that Britain was saved by the
bombs Hitler has rained upon her since the fall of France. Unless
they annihilate the British, these bombs will have fulfilled a function
Hitler never imagined. He thought they would terrorize the
British into surrender; instead the bombs aroused a resistance such
as no other population has ever shown, for the prolonged punishment
of Britain’s cities has been worse than anything we know of
elsewhere, including Belgrade, Warsaw, Rotterdam, Madrid, Barcelona,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
or Chungking. The British required this experience to
awaken them. They had been at war eight months when the
Germans finally attacked in the West, but they had not given up
the grand old British custom of the Friday to Tuesday week end.
It took the German break-through on the Meuse, and then the
German bombs on London, to shock every inhabitant of the British
Isles into the realization that they faced death for their nation and
death or slavery for themselves unless they fought with a ferocity
even greater than that of their jungle enemies.</p>

<p>We are today as sound asleep as the British were before May
1940. We are as sound asleep as the French were before they saw
their fortifications fall and their army of 4,500,000 soldiers with
the tradition of Napoleon dissolve between May 10 and June 17,
in five weeks of the greatest military debacle of all time. We have
had no bombs on America, and presumably shall not have them
until it is time to trek for the Rocky Mountains. A sober American
patriot remarked, “How fortunate Britain has been to have had
the bombs to arouse her martial spirit before it was too late. If
Hitler were to have a lapse in judgment and send just half a dozen
bombers over New York, and drop just half a dozen bombs, it
might be the salvation of America.” But Hitler will do no such
thing. He is glad to accommodate those Americans who refuse to
believe they are threatened until they are physically attacked.
When and if the Germans break through upon America we shall
awake to find ourselves alone, cut off, surrounded, outnumbered,
outgunned, and outlawed amid a world of enemies.</p>

<p>A few of us, chiefly correspondents formerly in Germany, have
been trying to do duty for German bombs on America, and for
the German break-through. We have been called alarmists. For
years the world of international observers was divided into two
groups: the one composed of nearly everybody on earth outside
of Germany, who understood nothing of the true character of
Hitler’s Third Reich; and the second tiny group, small enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>
be contained within a lecture hall, composed of correspondents,
diplomats, and a few businessmen who had firsthand knowledge
of what the Nazis mean. Today a good many persons without this
intimate knowledge of Nazi Germany have been able to decide
for themselves about the character of a regime which has overrun
fifteen countries in three years, but the danger to America still
looks very remote and impersonal to millions of patriotic citizens.
I have been talking to about 100,000 of these citizens, during a
lecture series.</p>

<p>My thesis was in brief: That the United States should be in a
state of formal, shooting war with Germany as speedily as possible
because only by this means can we make the world safe for America;
and that we must realize that after going to war we have only
begun a task which may last for many years and one which we
can fulfill only by learning to fight with even more fervor than
the demoniac Nazi shock troops, and by greater national self-sacrifice
than we have ever been called upon to make.</p>

<p>On this thesis I was asked around 3,000 questions during the
question period following the lectures. For this book I have chosen
around 200 as representative of what the American people are
thinking. I have arranged the questions in categories and have
added many recent ones to bring the Forum up to date. Eager,
painful, almost agonizing concern for the future of America was
the background of these queries from audiences in 128 communities,
including two-thirds of all cities of more than 100,000 population
and scores of towns and villages. The people with whom I
talked ranged from millionaire winter tourists in Florida to coal
miners in Pennsylvania, applegrowers in Yakima, oilmen in Oklahoma,
college boys in the Great Lakes states, farmers in the
Midwest, workers, bankers, club ladies, teachers, cowhands, Catholics,
Jews, Protestants, atheists, Yankees, Southerners, Texans,
Westerners&mdash;Americans.</p>

<p>I am convinced that these earnest Americans, representing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span>
through their family and friendly connections at least ten times
their number, or more than 1,000,000 persons, are far in advance of
the President’s moves toward active defense, just as the President
has always been far ahead of the Congress. They wanted action
even before the President offered it. Among 3,000 questioners
there were not more than six openly hostile hecklers from the floor.
Would it be too hopeful to say that America is 2,994 to 6 in favor
of liberty?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">1. GERMANY</h2>
</div>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Have you ever met Hitler?</em></p>

<p>A. Many times. From 1923 until today I have watched and studied
him and a good part of that time I was close enough to have opportunities
for firsthand observation. I first heard him speak in
August 1923, not long before his unsuccessful attempt to seize
power, in the famous Beer Hall Putsch, and then I witnessed the
Putsch, and reported his trial with Ludendorff for treason. He
was released from Landsberg Prison in December 1924 where he
had been held in comfortable “fortress confinement” just long
enough for him to have time conveniently to write <cite>Mein Kampf</cite>.
I interviewed him for the first time in the Brown House in Munich
in 1932. Thereafter I had a series of interviews with him, and was
present at many of the great moments of his career.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What impression does he make when you meet him?</em></p>

<p>A. The first impression he makes upon any non-German is that
he looks silly. Not to a German, mind you, and I suppose he did
not look silly to any of those heads of European states who crawled
to Berchtesgaden to get their orders. But to a foreigner not subject
to his commands he certainly looks silly. I know that is a strong
word to use about a man who has already conquered a continent
but it fits.</p>

<p>I remember well the first time I ever laid eyes on him, in August
1923, when he was speaking at the Zirkus Krone in Munich&mdash;I
broke out laughing. Even if you had never heard of him you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
would be bound to say, “He looks like a caricature of himself.”
The moustache and the lock of hair over the forehead help this
look, but chiefly it is the expression of his face, and especially the
blank stare of his eyes, and the foolish set of his mouth in repose.
Sometimes he looks like a man who ought to go around with his
mouth open, chin hanging in the style of a surprised farm hand.
Other times he clamps his lips together so tightly and juts out his
jaw with such determination that again he looks silly, as though
he were putting on an act.</p>

<p>Indeed Hitler is, more than anything else, an actor. He will go
on being one the rest of his life, a great actor who in his role as
tyrant conqueror will have affected the destinies of more millions
of people than any other human being in history, but an actor to
the last, a tragedian whom no one would take seriously until he
began shooting at his audience. Even in the midst of his triumphs
he manages to look silly to any outsider capable for the moment
of detaching himself from horrified contemplation of the fate inflicted
upon his victims.</p>

<p>I remember watching him roll down the Ringstrasse in Vienna
standing beside the chauffeur in a cream-colored Mercedes car,
with his arm outstretched in the stiff salute he affects on such
occasions, the hand rigidly held at a slight angle downward. It
was the moment of his conquest of Austria. The streets were
crowded with half a million people, a few cheering sincerely,
many cheering out of fear, and hundreds of thousands grim-faced,
weeping inwardly.</p>

<p>At that moment when I, too, felt like weeping at the abasement
of the city where I had worked and danced and studied and played
when I first came to Europe fifteen years before, even at such a
moment I found myself smiling and saying to friends looking out
the window of my room in the Hotel Bristol, “Doesn’t he look
silly?” That oversized cap of his, the military cap with the too-large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
crown and the visor which completely hides his low forehead!</p>

<p>There is something absurd even about his stance as he rides
his victorious chariot through freshly conquered cities. He is
softly fat about the hips and this gives his figure a curiously female
appearance. A scientist friend of mine watching him once remarked
that Hitler seemed afflicted by <em>steatopygia</em>, which he
defined as “an excessive development of fat on the buttocks, especially
in <em>females</em>.” It is possible that the strongly feminine element
in Hitler’s character is one of the reasons for his violence.
He realizes his femininity, is ashamed of it, wishes to be a man,
and overcompensates by brutal behavior. This little fatty-hipped,
slope-shouldered, lonely figure, standing so inflexibly, his arm
outstretched so tautly, his eyes staring over the heads of his subjects,
is incredible. “No,” you say to yourself, “this can’t be true.”</p>

<p>If this odd creature finally conquers the world, his last victims,
we once proud Americans, would still be saying as we filed into
concentration camp, “It’s impossible. He looks too silly.” But he is
not silly. My friend, Captain Philippe Barres of the French Army,
one of those who did not surrender, remarked to another Frenchman:
“You say Hitler is merely a madman, an idiot. I suppose you
must be one of those Frenchmen who prefer to have been conquered
by an idiot than by a clever man.”</p>

<p>Oh no, he certainly is not an idiot; but is it not incredible that
this mighty conqueror, now master over two hundred and fifty
million Europeans&mdash;more civilized white human beings than ever
before came under the tyranny of a single despot&mdash;and now reaching
out to drive another thousand million under his yoke, that this
man usually looks completely insignificant? I am sure that was the
first impression Mussolini had of him. I saw the two dictators when
they first met and Hitler never looked sillier in his life than at
that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How did the two behave toward each other? Did they seem
to like each other?</em></p>

<p>A. Not much. It was June 14, 1934 when Hitler first visited Italy
to meet the Duce and discuss with him the fate of Austria. Hitler
had not yet created his army and Mussolini could still talk on terms
of equality, or even a little better. Mussolini wanted to impress his
guest as much as possible with the power and glory of Fascist
Italy. Hitler had to try to impress Mussolini with the coming
strength of Nazi Germany. Mussolini, being at home, had all the
advantage. For Hitler the trip itself must have been a great experience
because it was the first time he had ever been out of Germany
or Austria in his whole life, if you except the time he spent
as a soldier in the trenches of Northern France.</p>

<p>Mussolini proved a great stage manager. He arranged the meeting
to take place in Venice, and had his guest land on the airfield
of the Lido. The fact that it was an island made it easy for the
authorities to exclude the public, and when Hitler arrived he
stepped directly into a perfectly appointed theater.</p>

<p>There were representatives of all the Italian armed forces, companies
of Bersaglieri, Alpini, Sailors, Airmen, and the Black Shirt
Fascist Militia, and a group of the highest civilian officials in black
uniform with the black-tasseled fez caps of the party, surrounding
the Duce himself who was in the powder-blue uniform of a Corporal
of the Fascist Militia.</p>

<p>Mussolini used to think of himself as the successor to the Corsican
Corporal. I remember once noticing that the only ornament
on his desk was a framed portrait of Napoleon. I remarked on it,
and Mussolini exclaimed, “A great Italian!” One of the Duce’s
most ambitious literary ventures was a play called <cite>The Hundred
Days</cite>. Whether he is still able after Greece, Libya, and Ethiopia
to fancy himself in the role of a conqueror when he meets Hitler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
now, he still appears in the uniform of a corporal as when he met
Hitler the first time.</p>

<p>The only persons on the field not in uniform were the foreign
correspondents and we looked very dim compared with the brilliant
Italians. Mussolini appeared a few minutes early and when he
strode down the line and looked over his warriors he made a most
vigorous impression. He had an electric step; his feet seemed to
bounce off the ground, and the air vibrated with his personality.
After he finished reviewing his troops he came over and stood
within a few feet of us and we waited.</p>

<p>Presently Hitler’s Junkers plane roared down out of the sky,
landed, taxied up to us, and came to a full stop. The door opened.
The Italian troops, dazzling in full dress, presented arms. The
Fascist officials stood at attention. The sunshine sparkled on Mussolini’s
gold braid and the Duce, stepping close to the open door of
the airplane, flung out his arm in a Roman salute with so much
energy that it seemed as though he might lose his hand. He trembled
with passion. Then, out of the shadow of the door, emerged
Hitler. There, before the splendid Italians, he stood, a faint little
man arrayed in his old worn raincoat, his blue serge suit, and a
brand-new Fedora hat. His right hand faltered up in the Nazi
salute.</p>

<p>He gives the salute two ways. For reviewing his own troops or
crowds he gives it stiff-arm. This is his Prussian style. For greeting
individuals he gives the salute, Viennese style, with a limp hand,
the arm not outstretched but bent at the elbow and the hand
flopping back until it almost touches his shoulder, then flopping
forward feebly. He used the Viennese version on Mussolini. Hitler
was embarrassed. Later we learned he had threatened to dismiss
Baron von Neurath, then chief of protocol, for having advised
him to come in civilian clothes.</p>

<p>The Fuehrer stood for a moment, blinking in the sunlight, then
awkwardly came down the steps, and the two dictators shook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
hands. They were not over three yards from me, and I was fascinated
to watch the expressions on their faces. Beneath the obligatory
cordiality I fancied I could see an expression of amusement
in Mussolini’s eyes and of resentment in Hitler’s. At any rate
Hitler’s embarrassment did not diminish, for when Mussolini led
him down the line of troops he did not know how to carry it off.
This was the first time he had ever had to inspect foreign troops,
but that was not the chief trouble. The chief trouble was his hat.</p>

<p>He had taken it off as a salute to the Italian flag, and he started
to put it back on his head, thought better of it, and held it in his
right hand. Then, as he walked beside the Duce, who was chattering
all the time in his fluent German, Hitler shifted the hat to his
left hand, then back to the right, and so back and forth until one
could feel he would have given anything to be able to throw the
hat away. Finally, when they reached the end of the line, he
clapped the hat back on his head, but he had not yet recovered
his poise because when they came to the launch which was to
carry them to Venice, Hitler, flustered, tried to insist that Mussolini,
the host, precede him on board. The Duce finally got behind
the Fuehrer and shooed him down the gangplank first.</p>

<p>Mussolini arranged that his visitor should constantly be reminded
that although Germany might have her great man, Italy
had a greater. With true totalitarian courtesy Mussolini ordered
thousands of young Black Shirts to cheer him and keep up a
continuous howl of “Duce, Duce, Duce!” whenever Hitler appeared.
They jammed St. Mark’s square and that night when Mussolini
gave his guests a banquet in the wonderful old Palace of the
Doges, the Black Shirts yelled so much and so powerfully that
nobody could hear the speeches. Finally Mussolini had to send
word for the boys to quiet down.</p>

<p>The show had its desired effect as far as the Italian populace
was concerned. The climax of the evening was a procession on
the Grand Canal. They had taken from museums the most treasured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
old gondolas, and decorated them with lanterns. You may
imagine what a spectacle they made under a June moon. My wife
had a gondolier who spoke a few words of broken English. She
asked him, “What do you think of Hitler?” “Oh,” said the gondolier,
“Eetlaire, Eetlaire is only a <em>piccolo</em> Mussolini.” I wonder
if the gondolier still thinks Hitler is a “little Mussolini”?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What did the two dictators accomplish by their meeting? Did
they lay the basis for the Axis there?</em></p>

<p>A. No, just the contrary. They laid the basis for nearly going to
war with each other. The Axis was not formed until much later,
after Mussolini had been compelled to recognize Hitler’s supremacy
and take orders from him. At the time they first met, Mussolini
still fancied himself Hitler’s superior. At Venice they were supposed
to negotiate an agreement about Austria.</p>

<p>At that time Mussolini wanted very much to take Austria himself,
or to keep it independent as a buffer state between Italy and
the Germany which he felt was going some day to become strong
enough to menace him as well as the rest of Europe. Hitler, on the
other hand, was bent upon the Anschluss, upon annexing Austria
as the first item on his program of expansion.</p>

<p>Mussolini had an army of unknown quality but big enough
compared with Hitler’s to make the Duce feel superior and Hitler
feel cautious. So they talked on this basis and Count Ciano, Mussolini’s
son-in-law and already Propaganda Minister, took me aside
the afternoon of the second day and triumphantly whispered that
a “gentleman’s agreement” had been reached that both parties
would respect the integrity and independence of Austria. It was
all I could do to restrain myself from putting in my cable some
obvious crack about the agreement between those two notable
“gentlemen,” but one does not do that under censorship.</p>

<p>What happened then? I must say that everything that has happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
in Europe since the gangsters took over has the quality of
a caricature. Sure enough, Hitler and Mussolini made their “gentlemen’s
agreement” to keep hands off Austria on June 15, and just
forty days later, on July 25, Hitler sent a band of Nazi revolutionaries
to seize the Austrian government. They murdered Chancellor
Dollfuss, but were overpowered by loyal troops, and before Hitler
could move, Mussolini had mobilized on the Brenner mechanized
forces strong enough to make Hitler back down and disavow the
whole action. I reached Vienna and the Ballhaus Platz while the
loyal troops were still besieging the Reichskanzlei. Dollfuss had
not died yet. In the midst of it all I had to laugh at the thought
of that “gentlemen’s agreement.”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>That must have made Mussolini cocky, to make Hitler back
down?</em></p>

<p>A. Decidedly! I went from Vienna where I had covered the Dollfuss
Putsch, back to Berlin for the death of Hindenburg&mdash;and incidentally
for a sidelight on Hitler, let me remark this. You still
hear repeated the wishful thought that the German Army will
some day “do something” about Hitler. Nobody who knows anything
about Germany believes that for a moment now, but I admit
I thought it possible until the day Hindenburg died that the army
might stop Hitler.</p>

<p>That was August 7, 1934, and at the moment Goebbels announced
on the radio the death of the President he also announced
that Hitler had assumed the presidency, which meant he was
commander in chief of the armed forces as well as Reichs Chancellor,
and thus had sole executive power. That morning I came early
to the office in Berlin and as I entered the door Goebbels’ voice
began to come over the radio. I worked on the cables until mid-afternoon
and then Dosch-Fleurot and I went out to witness the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
swearing in of the Berlin garrison. That was where I learned that
the army would from then on do nothing to stop Hitler.</p>

<p>The regiment was drawn up in hollow square and in the middle
stood the commanding general on a platform. Every one of the
2,000 men and officers held his right hand above his head with
the two fingers extended as in taking an oath in court. The general
repeated the words two at a time and the troops repeated in sonorous
chorus, “I swear&mdash;by God&mdash;eternal allegiance&mdash;to my Fuehrer&mdash;Adolf
Hitler&mdash;to obey him,” and so on, with no word about
the flag, the Constitution, or even the Fatherland. The oath was a
personal oath to Hitler himself, as commander in chief. I believe
it is unique; at any rate I have never heard of such an oath in any
other army.</p>

<p>The officers corps knew what it meant, so much so that thousands
of officers absented themselves that day from duty “on
account of illness,” but when they came back each had to take
the oath individually. The significance of that is that no German
army has ever mutined, and this oath bound every soldier of
Germany to the person of Adolf Hitler. It was a most impressive
ceremony and I carried away from it the conviction that this
army would never break its oath and turn on Hitler until it met
defeat. I am still convinced this is true.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Yes, but what about Mussolini? You said he was decidedly
cocky about defeating Hitler over Austria.</em></p>

<p>A. I started to say that after having covered the death of Hindenburg
and the accession to the Presidency of Hitler, I went down
and reported the Nuremberg Party Congress, and directly thereafter
went to Rome and met Mussolini. It was October 1934. I had
met him several times previously and he always used to insist on
asking more questions than he answered; so he began our conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
by saying, “I hear you have been to Nuremberg&mdash;what
did you learn there? What did they think of me?”</p>

<p>I answered that frankly the Italians were not popular in Nuremberg,
and that one of my English colleagues, Chris Holmes of
Reuters, who is tall, dark, and handsome, had once been mistaken
for an Italian and had some trouble with Nazi Storm Troopers
until he identified himself. “So we are unpopular there,” Mussolini
ruminated. “And go on, what else did you observe in that line?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I continued, “one night I met a group of officers of the
SS [<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schutzstaffel</i>] and we were talking about affairs, and one
of them asked me what you, Your Excellency, would have done
with those troops you mobilized on the Brenner during the Dollfuss
Putsch if you had marched into Austria.” “Yes,” said the
Duce leaning forward. “Yes, yes, go on, what did they want to
know?” “Well,” I hesitated, “they wanted to know if you had
marched into Austria, would you have stopped there, or would
you have gone on and marched into Germany?” Mussolini put
his hands on the desk and leaned halfway over it, and a great smile
came on his face as he ejaculated, “Ahhhh! Were they afraid?” I
laughed and he laughed and it was agreed that the Germans had
been afraid, and if ever there was a delighted man it was Mussolini,
reveling in the thought that he had frightened his gentlemen
friends.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You have told us that the first impression one gets of Hitler
is that he looks silly, but you remarked that this was a false impression....
Do you imply that on closer acquaintance his personality
grows upon you?</em></p>

<p>A. In a way, perhaps. At any rate you realize after several meetings
that the silly appearance is due to superficialities. His moustache,
the lock of hair over his forehead, and his staring eyes make
his face easy work for a cartoonist, and a world of them have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
advantage of it. It is almost like a mask. He frequently looks as
though he were gazing into space when he is looking straight at
you. He has terrific power of concentration and sometimes when
he talks he appears to forget his surroundings, and to be conversing
with himself, although he may be shouting loud enough to be
heard by a great multitude.</p>

<p>His manner is various, and he can be quietly affable just as
another time he may rave and bellow until his voice breaks. Once,
during his trial for treason, I heard him bellow and then surrender
to a louder voice. This was an incident worth recording, because
as far as I know it is the only time Hitler has been literally shouted
down. All during his trial the courtroom was dominated by the
figure of Ludendorff, the great Ludendorff who for the last two
years of the war had been master of Germany. Ludendorff of
course was as guilty of treason as Hitler, and if the court had done
its duty both Ludendorff and Hitler would have been sentenced
to death and executed. Ludendorff, however, had such prestige
that even this republican court was afraid to find him guilty, and
as you know, they acquitted him. And having acquitted Ludendorff
it was not possible to sentence Hitler to death. They gave
him the lightest possible sentence, fortress confinement for five
years, and later commuted by a general amnesty to less than a year.</p>

<p>Ludendorff used to bark at the court in <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kommandostimme</i>,
the tone of the parade ground, every syllable clipped harsh, and
when his imperious voice rose, the little Chief Justice in the middle
of the Bench would quiver until his white goatee flickered so
badly he had to seize it to keep it quiet. Hitler at that time had
nothing like the authority of Ludendorff but he made up for that
by his volubility and his rough treatment of the witnesses against
him. As defendant he had the right to question witnesses and he
bullied them unmercifully until the turn came of General von
Lossow, the chief witness for the state. Von Lossow was in command
of the Bavarian Reichswehr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>A few days before the Putsch, Hitler had given his personal
word of honor to von Lossow that he would not try a revolution.
On the night of the Putsch, Hitler, brandishing a revolver, forced
von Lossow to join the revolution and yield the Bavarian Reichswehr
to the new Hitler government. But the moment von Lossow
was free, he mobilized his troops and crushed the Putsch. So the
two men hated each other, and each considered the other a double-crosser.</p>

<p>When von Lossow took the stand, Hitler stood up and yelled a
question. Thereupon the General, a tall bony man, with a corrugated
shaven head and a jaw of steel, pulled himself up to his full
height and began yelling at Hitler and throwing his long forefinger
as if it were a weapon at Hitler’s face. Hitler started to shout back,
but the General shouted so much louder, and looked so menacing,
that presently Hitler fell back in his seat as if he had collapsed
under a physical blow. Hitler had his revenge on June 30, 1934
when he had von Lossow assassinated along with the hundreds of
others who perished in the Blood Purge. In retrospect it is fascinating
to reflect that Hitler, the most successful bully our world
has seen, can himself be bullied.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do you think that Hitler is personally responsible, or largely
responsible, for this war? Is it possible to ascribe that much importance
to one individual?</em></p>

<p>A. I do ascribe that much importance to the individual Hitler. We
would no more have had this war, in the form it has taken, and at
the time it has taken place, without Hitler, than we would have
had the Napoleonic wars without Napoleon. Without Hitler, Germany
would either have forged slowly ahead as she was doing
under the Weimar Republic, or she would have come under some
other leader of Pan-German Imperialism who would have attempted
on a lesser and not so successful scale something like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
thing Hitler has attempted. It is extremely unlikely that anyone
else could have been found with Hitler’s genius. It is more likely
that the Weimar Republic would have persisted. Remember, when
Hitler was sentenced to fortress confinement for his 1923 Putsch,
his National Socialist German Workers Party practically disappeared,
but immediately upon his emergence from prison it began
to grow until by 1928 he had 12 seats, and in 1930, 130 seats in
the Reichstag.</p>

<p>You may say this growth of a radical party would have been
inevitable under the circumstances of economic crisis, unemployment,
and so on. I agree that the growth of radical votes would
have been inevitable, but it was far from inevitable that so many
of these radical votes should be canalized into one great, super-efficient,
terroristic, militaristic party. This was the accomplishment
of one man, Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>I was a correspondent in Germany from 1923 on, and during
that particular decade, 1923 to 1933, when Hitler took power,
two-thirds of the German electorate voted consistently in favor
of some form of collectivism, either Social Democracy, or National
Socialism, or Communism. I contend that it was solely the genius
of Adolf Hitler which eventually brought the whole country under
his particular brand of collectivism. Without him the votes given
the Nazis would have been split in half a dozen ways, and the
probability is that the conservative parties representing one-third
of the votes, with the Social Democrats who wanted a democratic
republican collectivism, would have won out in the long run, and
we should have had a republican Germany today and no war. This
is sheer retrospective speculation, but it is useful to point out the
importance of the personality of Hitler.</p>

<p>The Marxists have always insisted that individuals do not count;
that history is made by economic and social forces which in the
long run accomplish their destiny no matter who lives or dies. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
longer I live the less I believe in this explanation of history, at any
rate as it applies to our span of life.</p>

<p>Over centuries it may be that the great forces carry mankind
irresistibly along no matter what leaders it has, but within a single
generation we are bound to feel that the history of our nation
would have been quite different if this or that individual had not
existed. Objectively it may be true that over long periods of time
the individual leader counts for little. But subjectively, for short
periods of time, the individual leader counts for nearly everything.
What a difference it would have made for the Jews of the whole
world, if a Hitler had not obtained control of the collectivist
movement in Germany.</p>

<p>There was nothing inherently anti-Semitic in the German yearning
for a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gemeinschaft</i>, a collective. Anti-Semitism need not have
played any part in National Socialism any more than it did in
Communism or Social Democracy. Yet, because Hitler from his
early youth had been infected with this curious kind of psychic
sickness, anti-Semitism became a part of the German state religion,
and from this accident of history has grown the tragedy of twelve
million people.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is Hitler really the boss of Germany, or is there not someone
behind the throne?</em></p>

<p>A. There is nobody behind the throne. Hitler is the whole regime,
its author, its parent, its spirit, its brains, and its boss.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What about the men around Hitler; are any of them of the
caliber to succeed him?</em></p>

<p>A. None of them is of the caliber to succeed Hitler, but Hitler
has publicly announced Goering as his successor, and he would
automatically take the position if der Fuehrer should die now. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the Party there is nobody to compete with him. The bloodthirsty
Himmler, head of the SS Elite Guards and the Gestapo, is merely
a policeman, one of great ability, ranking perhaps with the notorious
Fouché of the French Revolution, but out of the question as
Fuehrer. Goebbels, the advertising director, is the cleverest man
in the Party, but he would be lucky to remain alive twenty-four
hours after Hitler’s protective hand was removed. He and Himmler
are rivals in unpopularity. Who are the rest? Minor figures, as
Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, the upstart “Bismarck” of the champagne
trade, who if anything is more widely disliked and despised
than Goebbels. Hess, of course, has fled. Dr. Ley, the head of
the Labor Front, is the type of drunken, racketeering labor gangster
who in this country would have gone to the penitentiary under
the lash of Westbrook Pegler. Alfred Rosenberg, the Party’s
“brain,” could no more succeed Hitler than he could take Joe
Louis’s place.</p>

<p>The more one scrutinizes the German scene the more one realizes
that the war has moved all the big party figures far into the background,
leaving only Goering a modest place miles beneath the
Fuehrer. The outside world has believed Goering would be an
improvement on Hitler, in that he would be more amenable to
reason, less aggressive. He would be an improvement only in that
he would be weaker. His instincts and intentions are not more
Christian than Hitler’s. He would have neither Hitler’s magic hold
on the German people nor Hitler’s genius in action, but he is as
cruel a man as ever exercised power in a modern state. At the same
time he has all the sentimentality which is an almost invariable
accompaniment of brutality in this type of German. During the
period of the worst Terror, the active Nazi revolution in 1933,
Goering was over Himmler in charge of the concentration camps,
and at the moment when the Nazi sadists and criminals in charge
of the camps were beating to death and torturing and hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
scores of men daily, Goering decreed the severest law against
cruelty to animals ever to be passed anywhere.</p>

<p>Goering’s most marked characteristics, aside from his high animal
spirits, his callous cruelty, and his sentimentality, are his energy,
courage, and will power. He looks too fat to be self-disciplined, but
he twice cured himself of the morphine habit, which he had contracted
after his wounding in the World War, and again after his
wounding on the Odeon’s Platz during the Munich Putsch. A
glandular derangement resulting from his wounds made him monstrously
obese, but appears to have endowed him with an excess
of energy which he demonstrates by doing the work of half a
dozen men. He works incomparably harder than Hitler who by
any ordinary standards is a fitful worker, given to long spells of
dreamy idleness.</p>

<p>Everybody else in Germany quails before Goering, but Reichs
Marshal Goering becomes a trembling, whipped child when Hitler
yells at him, despite fanciful newspaper stories about Goering’s disputing
with der Fuehrer. The Army prefers Goering to any other
Nazi leader except Hitler, because Goering is the only soldier and
the only gentleman by birth among the Nazi chiefs. Yet when one
has reviewed all the points in favor of Goering’s position, it becomes
more and more obvious that the war has made a successor
to Hitler almost unthinkable. Hitler has the power now more than
ever, but the power now is the Army; it is no longer, as it was
until September 1939, the Party. If Goering were to take over
automatically, after Hitler’s death, how long could he keep the
apparatus running; what would the Army do; how would the
German people and the people of Europe respond to their new and
obviously so immensely inferior master? The more one considers
the condition of Germany today the more it seems that Hitler is
indispensable to German success. His successors would probably
succeed one another with Blitz speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What about Karl Haushofer, who is said to be his one-man
brain trust?</em></p>

<p>A. Haushofer is one of the men Hitler consults. Hitler likes Haushofer’s
theory of what they call <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geopolitik</i> because it fits in with
Hitler’s own theory that politics should always go ahead of economics,
which is his particular way of proving the Marxists wrong.
But Haushofer has no more influence than perhaps half a dozen
of Hitler’s advisers. Hitler hates experts, because they advance
objections to his projects. The only experts who have a chance
with him are yes-men, except in the Army. He listens to technical
advice from generals he respects, although even from them he
would tolerate no shadow of opposition to his grand strategy. You
may be sure Haushofer has never said no.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is Hitler also in the military sphere the real war lord? Does he
actually direct his battles as did Napoleon?</em></p>

<p>A. Hitler is the nearest thing to Napoleon since Napoleon. I remember
just before the beginning of the war, in August 1939, I
asked a Colonel of the French General Staff if they had heard that
Hitler had taken over active command of the Army, in fact, and
that when war began he would direct the fighting. The French
Colonel said yes, that the French General Staff knew that was true.
Then he surprised me by saying that they did not like it.</p>

<p>I had expected him to rub his hands and exclaim over French
good luck in having an amateur at the head of the German Army.
Not at all. This French Colonel went on to explain that Hitler had
already demonstrated the most miraculous sense of timing, and this
was perhaps the most important talent a field marshal could have,
and that with the technical advice of his generals, Hitler might
prove a formidable adversary indeed. Less than a year later the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
French Colonel who had foreseen so well was one of the vast army
of military refugees fleeing before the New Napoleon.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that Hitler blueprints each battle and determines
where each division is to go. He simply determines the grand
strategy, names the objective, and sets the time. For instance, in
the case of Poland, some time before the German attack, Hitler
called his General Staff together and said, “Gentlemen, I want
you to work out a plan for the crushing of Poland as swiftly as
possible. The problem is how to knock out Poland before the
French and British can bring any help or alleviation by attacking
in the West. Now, how many divisions can we have fully mobilized
within a month? So, and how many do we need to hold the
French? So. That will leave us so and so many for the Polish
campaign. Now, gentlemen, at how many different points can we
attack Poland, from every available entrance? You say five, including
East Prussia. All right, now within forty-eight hours I want
you to bring me a sketch plan of attack, with the outline of the
number of divisions to attack at each point.”</p>

<p>With these data in hand Hitler orders the general disposition of
the troops. Then he waits, and takes into account each of a score
or hundred other factors besides military factors that may enter
into the supreme decision to choose the exact time to strike. He
considers the attitude of all the powers involved, the British and
French morale, their military strength, the weather, the attitude
of Poland’s neighbors, the Polish preparations, and finally when he
is ready he gives the fateful order to march at 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on September
1, 1939. Before the order reaches the commanding generals probably
not more than half a dozen men in the world know the time.</p>

<p>He may meet technical criticism from his generals; he often
does. But unlike Mussolini, whose staff is so subservient and sycophantic
that they say “Yes” when the Duce has outlined some
impossible campaign such as his fiasco in Greece, the German
generals voice their objections. If the objections are valid, Hitler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
may change his plans. As a rule, however, Hitler’s grand strategy
is seldom affected, because the great sweeping decisions are based
upon Hitler’s appreciation of the problem, the campaign, the scene
as a whole. His generals will be thinking of the local problem, and
their opinion in this respect carries weight. But Hitler will be
thinking in terms first of the whole war, second of the whole
campaign, as against Poland. To these great decisions the generals
invariably bow.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why? How has this man who was able to become only a
corporal in the last war suddenly obtained such an ascendancy
over the German Army and in particular over the General Staff?
I always understood that the General Staff of the German Army
was one of the proudest, most professionally capable, and vain and
exclusive organizations in the whole world.</em></p>

<p>A. How has Hitler done it? By being always right. Well, nearly
always. He has so far made two mistakes, either or both of which
may prove fatal, or not, as destiny will have it. The first was when,
instead of launching an all-out assault on Britain immediately after
Dunkirk, he pursued the crumbling French Army, which as he later
learned, could not have been a danger to him; thus he postponed
too late his attack on Britain.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why didn’t he attack England at that time?</em></p>

<p>A. Because Hitler did not expect France to collapse as speedily as
she did. Neither he nor anyone else in the world expected it. He
may say he did but the best proof that he did not is the fact that
he failed to take advantage of it. When the German armies broke
through the Low Countries, and began to press upon the French
line at the famous “hinge” at Montmedy, they were like a man
who is pressing hard on a locked and bolted door when suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the bolt breaks, the door flies open, and the man pitches forward
into the room.</p>

<p>So the German armies pitched forward into France when they
broke across the Meuse and staggered on, almost losing their balance
for lack of the opposition they had expected to find. They
lurched on until at the end of five weeks the French Army had
dissolved; the French government had surrendered; the nation of
France had ceased to exist. Then Hitler pulled his army together,
turned it around, started it for the Channel ports. But it takes
time to turn an army around; it takes time to establish air bases and
collect the thousands of flat-bottomed vessels to ferry an army
across the channel.</p>

<p>The time required was fifty-five days from June 17, the day the
French asked for an armistice, to August 8, when the Germans
made their first mass air attack on Britain as preliminary to invasion.
It was those fifty-five days which saved Britain. I arrived
in London on June 20, full of the apprehension that Hitler’s army
was about to sweep the world. After all it is impressive to have
believed all your life that the French Army was the best in the
world and then to witness it disappear in thirty-seven days of
fighting.</p>

<p>It is more impressive to become a refugee. I had established in
Paris the first home I had had in twenty years of vagabond newspaper
work. As the German armies came closer to the French
capital I congratulated myself that I could now live at home and
motor daily to the front. Then one night around midnight the
American military attaché, my old friend Colonel Horace M.
Fuller, our wisest professional observer of the war abroad, and
Lieutenant-Commander Hillenkoetter, our naval attaché, veteran
submarine expert, called on me and said: “Knick, you must leave
tonight; the Germans will be here by morning.”</p>

<p>In Edgar Mowrer’s overfull Ford, followed by Lilian Mowrer
valiantly driving her tiny Simca, we left Paris about three o’clock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
in the morning, passing through empty streets, the great boulevards
stretching wide and forlorn without so much as a policeman
in sight, while fog eddied above the paving. We passed through the
gates of the city where not even a sentry stood.</p>

<p>Paris was already broken, already humiliated. We fled on down,
stopping with the demoralized government at Tours, and then on
to Bordeaux where with 1,600 other refugees I found a place on
the British India Line S.S. <em>Madura</em>, built to accommodate 160. On
the way from Paris to Bordeaux we had traveled with six to eight
million other refugees, the largest number of fugitives ever to
assemble on the roads of the Western World. Flight, flight, flight!
Anything to get away! That was the panic spirit which had
gripped the whole population of France, as of the Low Countries.</p>

<p>The German Army could not even come in contact with the
main body of refugees, except in the contact of murder when the
Luftwaffe machine-gunned the roads. From the moment, eleven
days after the grand assault began, when the Germans reached the
sea at Abbeville, May 21, from that moment on French resistance
disappeared. But Hitler could not begin to attack England until
the British Expeditionary Force and the Northern French Army
were destroyed. Actually the B.E.F. escaped from Dunkirk June 4,
and from that date on Hitler was free to turn in either direction,
and many observers believed he would drive straight at England.</p>

<p>Instead, he chose to pursue the French Army another thirteen
days, until it surrendered. If Hitler, immediately after Dunkirk,
had concentrated every resource on invading England, nobody can
say what would have happened. Dunkirk had shocked the British
more deeply than anything in 100 years, but the French capitulation
shocked them worse.</p>

<p>By the time I arrived at Falmouth, after four days on deck with
my fellow refugees, the British were still dazed, dismayed, not
panicky, but desperately aware that they stood closer to national
destruction than ever in 1,000 years. The truth was they had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
army, or rather their army had no weapons. The B.E.F., which
had possessed about 75 per cent of all the weapons possessed by all
the British Land Forces, had been compelled to leave behind at
Dunkirk all their tanks, cannon, and most of their machine guns
and even their rifles. It was terrifying to stand on the curb in London
and watch battalions of the Guards march by with only half a
dozen rifles to a battalion.</p>

<p>The British Land Forces immediately after Dunkirk were practically
weaponless. The R.A.F. which was soon to give so gallant
an account of itself, needed reorganization; all the units which had
been in France had to be brought back and reintegrated for the
defense of the island. If ever the German invasion could succeed,
it could have succeeded then, but Hitler did not move until the
night of August 8, when he sent over his first mass of 400 bombers
and fired the docks of London in a blaze so high I was able to read
a newspaper by its light on the roof of the Ministry of Information
building, eight miles from the fire. Had that attack been
launched June 8 or even June 18, instead of August 8, who knows
what the result would have been? By August 8 the British had been
transformed.</p>

<p>Three things had happened to them which had not happened for
over 100 years, since the time of Napoleon. First, they had become
frightened; second, they had become angry; third, they had been
forced, again I repeat, for the first time in 100 years, forced to go
to work. Until the fall of France the British had been as easygoing
as we are now, despite the fact they had been formally at
war for eight months; but after the fall of France every able-bodied
human being in the United Kingdom went to work at the
rate of ten to twelve hours a day seven days a week.</p>

<p>In a miraculously short time they tripled their production of
weapons, planes, ammunition; meanwhile we sent them 1,000 cannon,
many machine guns, and 750,000 rifles. The R.A.F. trained,
reorganized, expanded, laid out new fields. In short, when Hitler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
attacked he struck a new Britain, aroused as never since 1066. It
was a dazzling example of what danger can do to a people. The
British of August 1940 were not the British of June 1940.</p>

<p>Historians will wonder why Hitler did not move earlier against
England. I suppose they will go on wondering why for centuries,
even after Hitler has explained it in his memoirs, for his own benefit,
and to the satisfaction of few. My estimate is that he simply
overvalued the French Army and undervalued the British spirit.
Surprised by the French collapse he was carried along by the
momentum of his drive to destroy the possibility of further French
resistance before trying to invade England. He lost thereby what
may prove to have been his greatest chance when he failed to
throw his whole air force, army, and navy at England in the
moment of her greatest weakness.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What was Hitler’s second mistake?</em></p>

<p>A. His second mistake was when he went into Russia, apparently
expecting the Red Army to fold up at least as fast as the French
Army, probably hoping to be able to turn around and launch a
second attack on Britain in 1941 before American aid became
effective. The initial effect of the invasion of Russia was a disappointment
to Hitler, however it may eventually end. So was the
First Battle of Britain, but the final outcome of both battles must
be awaited to determine how they will affect Hitler’s reputation as
a master of war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his generals have not had reason to change fundamentally
the judgment they formed on the basis of their experience
with him since 1933. That experience began when he took over the
Presidency and obtained the oath of allegiance which, as we have
seen, laid at least a legal foundation for his ascendancy over the
armed forces. Then he set out to build out of the 100,000-man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Reichswehr the mightiest military machine the world has ever
known.</p>

<p>He denounced the military clauses of the Versailles treaty, and
thus relieved the Army of its crushing sense of being condemned
forever to inferiority. He boldly announced the creation of an Air
Force, and assigned to it the explosive energies of his first Paladin,
Goering. Thereafter, all the resources of the nation were poured
into the armed forces. Nothing was too good for the troops. They
were given barracks such as no European army had ever had, as
good as anything the United States Army has ever known. The
food of the army and navy and air force was improved until it was
on the average far better, even in peacetime, than anything the
German soldier had to eat at home.</p>

<p>Discipline was kept at its highest point, but at the same time a
new spirit of comradeship came into the German armed forces.
For the first time in the history of the German Navy, officers and
men would eat at the same table. All this was bound to have its
effect upon the services and to make them think at any rate gratefully
of Hitler, but of course the test had still to come. What
would this commander in chief order his troops to do? Would he
lead them into some impossible adventure prematurely? Would
this amateur after building his beautiful machine sacrifice it in
some vainglorious maneuver? It seemed as though he would do
just that.</p>

<p>The first test of Hitler’s fitness to command his army came on
March 7, 1936, when he ordered it into the Rhineland to reoccupy
that portion of Germany adjoining France which had been demilitarized
by the Versailles treaty. France had insisted that Germany
should promise never to quarter troops on the right bank of the
Rhine. This was to make up for the fact that France had been prevented
from occupying the right bank of the Rhine, and for the
fact that the United States in 1919 had refused to join the proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
tripartite pact of France, England, and the United States, to
guarantee the French from invasion by Germany.</p>

<p>As long as the Germans kept out of the Rhineland, France was
safe. If the Germans ever reoccupied the Rhineland, it meant that
they intended sooner or later to use it as a jumping-off-place from
which to attack France. France therefore had insisted upon and
had obtained this clause in the Versailles treaty, and had thereafter
frequently announced that its violation would mean war. Nevertheless,
Hitler toward the middle of February 1936 informed his
General Staff that in the first week of March he intended to reoccupy
the Rhineland. At that moment Hitler met his first opposition
from the Army. The generals protested that they could not be
responsible for what would happen, because if the French mobilized
and fought, the German Army was not strong enough&mdash;it
would have to retreat. Unspoken was the conclusion that if the
German Army retreated, it would mean the end of the Nazi
regime, the end of Hitler.</p>

<p>Hitler replied that it was the duty of the Army to obey orders;
it was his duty as Fuehrer to give orders which could be successfully
obeyed. “I know,” he told them, “that the French will not
mobilize. I know the French will not fight. I know the English
don’t want them to fight. Don’t ask me how I know. I know. It
is my business to know.”</p>

<p>When I was in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, I learned
under unusual circumstances something of what went on inside the
German General Staff during those days of March 1936, which
were to decide the history of the continent. At Burgos, headquarters
of Franco’s government, I met Major von der Osten, who was
ostensibly in charge of certain economic investigations or negotiations,
but as a matter of fact was the chief of the German Gestapo
in Spain. He was an agreeable fellow, father of eight children,
highly intelligent, amusing, and it did not matter to me that some
months before, his organization, the Gestapo, had had me arrested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and thrown into a death cell in San Sebastian for thirty-six hours,
whence I escaped by the determined vocal and political efforts of
my friend and fellow correspondent, Randolph Churchill.</p>

<p>The Major knew that I knew that he was chief of the Gestapo
and he knew that I would do all I could to get information from
him of value to me, as I knew he would do likewise with me. So we
got along famously, and one day he included me in a picnic with
several other correspondents. There, on the banks of a clear
stream while the Major’s soldier servants served us grilled frankfurters
and Rhine wine, I led the conversation into discussion of
what the Army thought of Hitler. The theme reached the reoccupation
of the Rhineland, and at this the Major became enlightening.</p>

<p>“I was assigned to the Bendlerstrasse [headquarters of the General
Staff] then,” the Major said. “I can tell you that for five days
and five nights not one of us closed an eye. We knew that if the
French marched, we were done. We had no fortifications, and no
army to match the French. If the French had even mobilized, we
should have been compelled to retire.” He confirmed that the
opinion of virtually the entire General Staff was against Hitler;
they considered the move suicidal, and when they did move, it was
only to obey orders, not because they were convinced it was right.</p>

<p>“And what did they think after the thing was all over and Hitler
had been proved right? Did they think that Hitler had proved
himself a genius or that he just had extraordinarily good luck?”</p>

<p>The Major smiled. “We thought there was a good deal of kind
fortune concerned,” he said.</p>

<p>That was Hitler’s first brush with his army, and his generals
may well have put him down as lucky. He won, and later events
proved how tremendous his victory was. For the occupation of
the Rhineland enabled Hitler to build there his Siegfried line, and
the Siegfried line enabled him eventually to hold France until he
was ready to fall upon and destroy her as he did in 1940.</p>

<p>This first demonstration that he was “always right,” strengthened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
his position with the General Staff enormously. The second
test was accordingly easier. It was Austria.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of the Rhineland, so in the case of Austria,
France had often declared that any German attempt to annex
Austria would be a cause of war. This made good sense, just as it
had made good sense for the French to have said they would go to
war to prevent reoccupation of the Rhineland. Once the Germans
had the Rhineland and began to fortify it, they made it difficult for
the French to defend Austria. Once the Germans had Austria they
made it difficult for the French to defend Czechoslovakia. Once
the Germans had Czechoslovakia they made it difficult for the
French to defend France.</p>

<p>The German generals understood this series of steps as well as
or better than the French, and therefore they could not believe
that the French would allow each step to be taken without trying
to stop it. Therefore, as Hitler ordered each step taken, his generals
protested, since like all generals they did not want to start a
war without the certainty of winning.</p>

<p>They protested vigorously over the decision to go into Austria,
but once again Hitler said: “Gentlemen, it is your business to take
the action I direct. It is my business to direct only action which
will be successful. I can assure you now, as I assured you on the
reoccupation of the Rhineland, that now also France will not
move, the British will not move; we can do as we like.” He was
right again, and now with two major victories to his credit, he
could face his generals with an even more momentous and critical
order&mdash;to occupy Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>This third move, against Czechoslovakia, was the most critical,
because here France was pledged by her solemn word of honor to
fight for her ally, and because the possession of Czechoslovakia
would make it possible finally to attack France herself. These two
facts were of course amply known to the German generals and
once more they assumed that the French generals and the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
government would now awaken and fight for the life of their
country.</p>

<p>So, in spite of the two lessons Hitler had given them, the German
generals once more pointed out the dangers. Their Siegfried
line was not nearly complete. If they threw crushing weight at
Czechoslovakia, they would have to weaken their West Front so
badly that the French, if they wished to plunge, might break
through. Hitler this time was beside himself. He not only knew
the French and British would not fight if the Czechs asked them to
fight, but he believed, and I think he was right, that the French
and British would not have fought even if the Czechs had fought.</p>

<p>So he wanted above all things at this juncture to meet a little
opposition to blood his sword. He wanted the Czechs to fight,
and knowing he would have them alone, he longed for a chance to
show what his vast army and air force could do with overwhelming
odds on their side. In my opinion it is just the opposite of true
to say that Hitler wanted another bloodless victory. He did not.
He wanted a bloody one, the blood of course, to be shed by the
hopelessly outnumbered enemy. It seemed to him absolutely idiotic
that any of his generals should object. They did, but feebly.</p>

<p>Once more Hitler overrode them, with the same arguments.
“France will not fight. The British will not fight. We can do as we
like with the Czechs. I only hope they do fight.” Hitler this time
got everything he wanted but one thing. The Czechs, brutally
betrayed by their ally France and bullied by England, did not
fight. Hitler was cheated of his desire to do violence. At Munich
the bad temper he displayed when Chamberlain and Daladier gave
in to him on every point was caused by the fact that he realized
these good gentlemen were going to make the Czechs surrender.
He was not going to be given the chance to drop one bomb. He
had to wait a whole year for his bloodshed.</p>

<p>If you doubt this analysis of Hitler’s bloodthirstiness, recollect
that he never gave Poland a chance to imitate Czechoslovakia’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
surrender. Would it not be a matter for wonderment if the German
generals had failed to be impressed by this third example of
the Fuehrer’s infallibility?</p>

<p>Yet when he proposed to destroy Poland even after the British
and French had “guaranteed” her, some of Hitler’s generals still
cautiously offered objections on the grounds that this would inevitably
mean the Great War and maybe they could not win the Great
War. For the fourth time Hitler overcame constantly lessening
opposition of “timid” generals. He explained that he would knock
out Poland before the French or British could strike, if indeed they
intended to strike at all.</p>

<p>There was some doubt whether the Allies would really fight.
Ribbentrop insisted Britain was through, and although they might
declare war and mobilize, the British would do so only to save
face, and would take the first opportunity to quit with a negotiated
peace. But even if the British and the French did go to war,
Hitler explained, he would finish Poland swiftly, and then turn
such heat on France, bring such terrific forces to bear on the Western
Front, that she would probably also be ready to negotiate
peace, and if not he would knock her out also. <em>That</em> he was sure he
could do, and once he had done that, the British would capitulate.</p>

<p>If there was any opposition lingering among the generals, it disappeared
upon the signature of the Russo-German Pact, August
23, 1939. This most brilliant of all Hitler’s foreign political coups
convinced his generals first that they would not have to fight a war
on two major fronts, second that they were in the hands of an
invincible military-political genius of the first category.</p>

<p>How gloriously right Hitler seemed to be. At first everything
appeared to depend upon the speed with which Hitler could knock
out the Poles, whether he could finish them off before the French
could mobilize for a great offensive on the West. Optimistic Poles
said they could hold out for three years; pessimistic Poles said one
year. The French thought the Poles could hold for six months.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
The German generals thought it would take three months to break
the Poles. Hitler gave them six weeks to do the job. They conquered
Poland in eighteen days!</p>

<p>Then came Norway and then came France!</p>

<p>No matter what the German generals had thought before, by
May 1940 they had the feeling Hitler was another Napoleon. Sure
enough, on May 10, they attacked and on June 17 the French
Army, the mighty French Army of 4,500,000 men only three generations
from Napoleon, surrendered. The Germans, led by Hitler,
had accomplished the greatest victory in the history of the German
Army, and had inflicted upon their age-old enemy the most colossal
defeat in the history of France. Indeed from the point of view
of the numbers of men involved, and the issues at stake, it may be
said to be dimensionally the greatest victory of military history.</p>

<p>How can anyone now wonder that after the fall of France the
German General Staff with all its professional vanity would be
proud to take and if necessary blindly obey orders from Corporal
Hitler?</p>

<p>Hitler had brought his General Staff to this position of unquestioning
obedience when he gave the orders to attack Russia. Here
was truly the place for caution. If Hitler was another Napoleon,
here was the same Russia. It meant a two-front war. It would give
time for United States aid to become effective. At the best it meant
lengthening the war by years.</p>

<p>“No,” Hitler ordered, “we shall conquer Russia before the summer
is out, and conquer England before the year is out and before
the United States can do anything about it. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vorwaerts!</i>” Only the
prestige built up by Hitler’s uninterrupted series of victories from
the Rhineland to Crete could have won the acquiescence of the
German General Staff to the Russian adventure.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is Hitler personally brave?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>

<p>A. It is hard to say. I could put it this way: Hitler is not the sort
of man about whom one would unhesitatingly say that he is personally
brave, as one would say about Churchill, for example. Perhaps
we shall not count the story he told me about his winning the
Iron Cross in the last war, since many Germans say it is not a true
story. Yet it is an interesting one. He told it to me the night of
March 11, 1932 on the eve of the Presidential election when he
ran against Hindenburg and scored eleven million to Hindenburg’s
eighteen million votes.</p>

<p>I asked him how he had won his Iron Cross. He always wore it
but his political enemies declared there was no record in the army
archives of its having been awarded him and neither in <cite>Mein
Kampf</cite> nor elsewhere could there be found any account of how he
got it. I was afraid when I asked the question that it might irritate
him, but he seemed amused, and even pleased.</p>

<p>“You know,” he said, “I was a dispatch bearer in the war. One
day, toward the first of June 1918, I was ordered to take a message
to another part of the front, and had to traverse a section of no
man’s land. Presently I passed a dugout which I thought abandoned,
but suddenly I heard French voices below.</p>

<p>“Being alone, and armed only with a pistol, I stopped a moment,
then drew my pistol and shouted below in my very bad French,
‘Come up, surrender!’ Then I shouted in German as though to a
squad of soldiers, orders to ‘Fix bayonets! Draw your hand grenades!’
First one French soldier, and then another, and then another
came up with their hands in the air until there were seven. I
marched them to the rear and turned them over as prisoners of war.
Now,” he paused, and smiled at Tom Delmer of the London <cite>Daily
Express</cite>, who was with me, “if they had been English soldiers, or,”
turning to me and continuing to smile, “if they had been American
soldiers, I am not sure I should have been able to make them surrender
so easily, and perhaps I would not have my Iron Cross or be
here today.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<p>This is the only time I have observed a sense of humor in Hitler,
and of course if his story is correct, it proves that he had on that
occasion a considerable amount of personal bravery.</p>

<p>Then there is the time when, during the 1923 Munich Beer
Hall Putsch, he threw himself down when the Reichswehr armored
car began to fire its machine gun at him and Ludendorff and Goering
and the rest of them. I was about a hundred yards away,
jammed in the crowd, when I heard that machine-gun fire, the first
I had ever heard in my life. That one whiff of fire killed sixteen
of Hitler’s men including the body servant of Ludendorff standing
next to the General whom he had served throughout the war.
Hitler was injured because he had thrown himself down so violently
that he broke his collarbone. Would you consider that a sign of
cowardice? I do not know. It was the proper reaction for a front-line
soldier.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ludendorff not only refused to take shelter but
contemptuously stalked across the Odeon’s Platz and, in his uniform
of a Lieutenant General, gave himself up to the Reichswehr
Lieutenant in charge of the armored car, with the words: “Arrest
me, Lieutenant. I shall never wear this uniform again.” Now there
was a man about whom one would unhesitatingly say he is a brave
man. You remember how Ludendorff, then a Colonel, took the
fortress of Liege singlehanded, simply drove in his staff car to the
Belgian lines, by amazing luck got through, drove straight to the
entrance of the fortress, knocked, and walked in. When the Belgian
commander saw before him a German Colonel, he assumed the
game was up and surrendered. That won for Ludendorff the Pour
le Merite, Germany’s Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>There was a time when Hitler displayed indubitable personal
courage. That was when he arrested Captain Ernst Roehm, the
head of his 2,500,000 Storm Troops, on the famous June 30, 1934,
the day of the Blood Purge. Roehm had been Hitler’s close, if not
closest, personal associate. I cannot use the word friend, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Hitler has never had a friend. He was the only man in the party,
in the world, as a matter of fact, with whom Hitler exchanged the
intimate “Du” or “Thou.” We Americans can never understand
the significance of this continental custom. If you are on “Du Fuss”
or “Thou Footing” with another man, it means you are brothers,
and it is taken very seriously indeed by all except the proletariat,
who in the informal brotherhood of the working classes, call each
other indiscriminately “Thou.” But this intimacy of Hitler and
Roehm did not prevent Hitler from cold-bloodedly ordering his
friend’s execution when once Hitler had convinced himself Roehm
was plotting treason. Cold blood is one of Hitler’s chief characteristics.
It reminds one of Robespierre.</p>

<p>Roehm was hiding out with his staff at the hamlet of Wiessee,
not far from Munich. His guards, heavily armed, had strictest
orders to stop everyone, but <em>everyone</em>, and by that underlining
emphasis in the orders, <em>everyone</em> was meant to include Hitler
himself. Nevertheless, on the fateful morning, Hitler with two
automobiles containing among others the canny Goebbels, several
high SS officers, and a handful of SS gunmen, drove into Wiessee
at daybreak, and when Roehm’s guards saw the All-Highest, instead
of stopping him they saluted “Heil Hitler!” There was at least some
bravery in Hitler’s daring to go personally to arrest Roehm, surrounded
by his bodyguards. Once he had penetrated the sentry
lines, there was not much for Hitler to fear, especially not in his
personal encounter with Roehm. He found Roehm in bed with
what they call in German a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lust Knabe</i>.</p>

<p>Roehm was a barrel-chested, scar-faced desperado whose only
two weaknesses were his homosexuality and drink. He had grown
potbellied, and invariably woke with a hangover. He slept in a
nightgown. When Hitler flung open his bedroom door at daybreak
and routed him out of bed, Roehm must have been distinctly
at a disadvantage. There he stood, bleary-eyed, nightgowned, potbellied,
before his Fuehrer roaring charges of treason, yelling that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
he was under arrest, ordering him to dress and be quick about it.</p>

<p>I passed through Munich on my way from Rome to Berlin to
cover the Blood Purge the next night. From SS officers who boarded
my train at Munich, via the good-looking Italian Wagon-Lit conductor
who had been from time to time propositioned by Roehm,
I learned that Major Buch, Hitler’s chief SS executioner, had that
evening gone to Roehm’s cell where a revolver had been left to let
him commit suicide, and had shot Roehm as he cried, “Tell Adolf
to come kill me if he has the nerve!”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is it true that Hitler is a homosexual?</em></p>

<p>A. No, it is not true. He came seriously under suspicion because
of his intimacy with Roehm, and because for so many years he
tolerated the blatant homosexuality of Roehm and his cohorts.
This was a scandal so colossal that it surely has no counterpart in
history. Roehm as the head of 2,500,000 Storm Troops had surrounded
himself with a staff of perverts. His chiefs, men of the
rank of Gruppenfuehrer or Obergruppenfuehrer, commanding
units of several hundred thousand Storm Troopers, were almost
without exception homosexuals. Indeed, unless a Storm Troop
officer were homosexual, he had no chance of advancement.</p>

<p>All this was known to every intelligent observer in Germany
and of course was known in every detail to Hitler. His moral indignation
when he made his Blood Purge and cleaned out this “nest of
immorality” was one of his more brazen pieces of hypocrisy. He
purged Roehm not on account of his distasteful habits but because
Roehm was plotting to seize power, make himself head of the
Army, and form what would have been, incidentally, a homosexual
government.</p>

<p>Nobody knows whether he intended to do away with Hitler or
merely force Hitler to go along with him. At any rate Hitler
would have no part of it, and Roehm was killed, though not for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
his abnormal love life. Thereafter Hitler passed the most stringent
edicts against homosexuality and this odd feature of German life
was driven underground. It remains, nevertheless, characteristic of
the Germans, that they, outwardly the most brutally masculine of
all European peoples, are the most homosexual nation on earth.</p>

<p>Naturally because Hitler never showed any sign of interest in
women, he came under suspicion, but prolonged observation has
convinced all the witnesses I know, including Germans and foreigners,
that Hitler is simply asexual, has no sex life at all, or rather
has sublimated it in his “marriage to the German people.”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How do you mean, “marriage to the German people”?</em></p>

<p>A. That is precisely the relationship Hitler conceives himself to
have with the Germans, and I must say millions of Germans appear
to feel as though they constituted his wife. Incidentally it was Lord
D’Abernon, long-time British Ambassador to Germany, who remarked
that the world did not properly understand the meaning
of masculinity and femininity as applied to nations, and that in his
opinion the Germans were the most feminine people in Europe
and the French the most masculine. Whether D’Abernon would
today be of the same opinion, I do not know. At any rate Hitler
certainly obtains from his contact with the German people a more
than adequate surrogate for normal sex life.</p>

<p>Just imagine what his feelings must be when he stands, as in
peacetime he used to stand, on the platform at the Tempelhofer
Field in Berlin, and before him are a million Germans. This is the
largest crowd that any man has ever had before him in person.
You could never assemble such a crowd in a democracy, because
it takes them twelve hours to march into place and twelve hours
to march away.</p>

<p>On the night before the first of May, which the Nazis stole from
the Communists and Socialists and made their own Labor Day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the Berlin population is herded into line and marched off in battalions.
Everything is meticulously arranged by a General Staff,
so that by the time Hitler appears one million persons, no less,
are standing to hear him. When Hitler appears, from a million
throats roars the cry “Heil Hitler! Heil! Heil! Heil!” time and
time and time again.</p>

<p>Then he speaks and at every possible opportunity comes again
the bellow from a million German voices “Heil! Heil! Heil!”
Sounds silly? Oh no, not any more than the German goose step is
silly. It looks silly only in the movies. In real life it is tremendously
impressive&mdash;ten thousand steel-shod boots striking the ground with
all the force ten thousand muscular legs can put into it. They
shake the ground, and when the million Germans shout “Heil!”
they make the firmament quiver. I defy anyone to hear such a mass
yell without trembling at the sheer brute power of it.</p>

<p>Suppose you were the recipient of this ovation! Hitler obtains
his life’s satisfaction from this sort of power orgasm. Now, of
course, he has the whole continent of Europe to trample upon.
Every man who loves power for its own sake as Hitler does, has
a strong streak of sadism, of enjoyment in the infliction of pain
or humiliation upon others. So now Hitler has a double stream of
enjoyment in which to wallow. I do not think he will ever marry.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Are women attracted to Hitler?</em></p>

<p>A. Soon after he came to power he had to pass an edict forbidding
German women to crawl out of the crowd and attempt to kiss
the hem of his raincoat as he passed by. This was forbidden partially
for the same reason as the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Verbot</i> against throwing flowers,
which was issued because it would be easy to conceal a bomb in
a bouquet. Whenever he appeared in public, scores of German
women tried to get near enough to him to touch his raincoat or
come into some kind of personal contact with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<p>It is, regrettably, impossible to record that this is a purely German
phenomenon. An American woman distinguished herself at
the Olympic Games, and incidentally brought about a disciplinary
shake-up among Hitler’s bodyguards, by brushing past his gunmen
and kissing him on the cheek. All this is, perhaps, only evidence of
the traditional regard women have for strength, whether exhibited
by the champion prize fighter, wrestler, chess master, millionaire,
or by the Fuehrer of Germany.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>I have heard scores of you fellows, foreign correspondents and
others, say they “know the truth about Hitler,” and constantly
recommend that we find out what he means, but that seems to be a
pretty complicated business, and we cannot all live in Germany
long enough to find out about it. Can you tell us in a few words
just what he does mean, for us?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, in the fewest words: Hitler means exactly what he says.
He says the German people are a master race, destined to rule the
world. He says the German people have the power to enforce their
rule on the world. He intends that they shall rule the world during
his lifetime. He includes the United States in the world he intends
to rule.</p>

<p>Finally, he does have the power to carry out his world conquest
unless we fight him in time. That is the shortest way to put it. The
reason you think it hard to understand or find out what Hitler
means is that you refuse to believe these things because they upset
you, and if you believed them then you might have to work harder,
or sacrifice something such as your automobile, or blood, or maybe
your life. Read <cite>Mein Kampf</cite>. It is all there.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What kind of public speaker is Hitler? Is he truly a great
orator? How does he compare with others?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<p>A. He is probably the greatest spellbinder of all time. He literally
talked himself into power in Germany and thereafter he talked the
great German nation into becoming his blindly obedient and fanatically
loyal Herculean slave. With his slave he has laid a continent
in chains. But he never delivered an oration in his life, because an
oration according to Webster is “An elaborate discourse, delivered
in public, treating an important subject in a formal and dignified
manner,” and that Hitler never did. In this respect, Goebbels is
incomparably his superior.</p>

<p>An oration by Goebbels has a beginning, a middle, and a crescendo
end; it has form, style, and the language is chosen, the gestures
sparing but effective, the voice clear and only now and then
distorted by passion. Hitler begins any old way, rambles, digresses,
becomes excited, rants, shouts until his voice is hoarse, and frequently
breaks into a falsetto scream.</p>

<p>The quality of Hitler’s voice is unpleasant. It is thick in the
middle register, guttural in the low, and its high notes are rasping.
In every speech at some time he becomes angry and then the tone
is either terrifying or embarrassing to the listener, depending upon
his relation to Hitler’s power. I speak, of course, of the foreign
listener, as it would affect you if you understood German. His
anger frequently overpowers him, but he never splutters, he roars.
I sometimes felt as I listened to him, and I have heard him fifty
times or more, as though he were a wild beast.</p>

<p>Then he can shift in a twinkling to the tone of irony, contemptuous,
derisive. Much of his speech is ungrammatical; many
of his sentences do not “read,” do not make German. He pays
apparently no attention to the structure of his speech. He sometimes
ends so abruptly that his audience is shocked, having expected
him to finish his thought, or even complete a sentence. His gestures
are extravagant, and resemble those of an old-fashioned camp-meeting
preacher. He mimics well, and delights in ridiculing his opponents
by caricaturing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>There is scarcely a rule of oratory he does not ignore. He is
seldom dignified. All of this, of course, is in reference to his extemporaneous
public speaking which brought him to power, not to the
speeches he reads, as he has read nearly everything since he took
power. As Chancellor of the Reich he can read a speech with
dignity, as he read the funeral oration over Hindenburg, which I
heard in Tannenberg.</p>

<p>Yet with all the criticism one can bring to bear on his public
speaking, he remains the most effective mob master ever to step
on a platform. He sweeps his audience with him. Sometimes they
are slow to come along, as the time when after seven days of
slaughter in Germany he rose in his own uniformed Reichstag to
explain the Blood Purge of June 30, 1934. That time he spoke for
twenty minutes before he received a single handclap. He had just
killed more than a thousand people including leaders of his own
party, Ernst Roehm, his closest friend and head of the 2,500,000
Storm Troops; Gregor Strasser, one-time rival for leadership of
the Nazis; General Kurt von Schleicher, former Reichs Chancellor,
and his wife; Karl Ernst, head of the 250,000 Berlin and Brandenburg
Storm Troopers; General von Lossow and former Reichs
Commissar von Kahr of Bavaria, who had defeated his first effort
at seizing power in Munich, and hundreds of others.</p>

<p>The nation was stunned; the Nazi Party itself was partially
paralyzed with fear. Hitler had turned his SS (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schutzstaffel</i>) Black
Guards against his SA (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sturmabteilung</i>) Storm Troops, and hundreds
of Brown Shirt officers had died before the Black Shirt firing
squads, many of them shouting “Heil Hitler!” as they fell. Most
of the members of the Reichstag, that curious gesture of Hitler
before democracy, were active or honorary officers in the Storm
Troops. A score of seats were empty. Their lawful occupants were
dead. The survivors were appalled and not less bewildered than
the public. Nobody knew what had happened; what to expect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
When Hitler began to speak, for the first time in his life he was
received in silence.</p>

<p>As I sat in the press gallery of the Kroll Opera House, I noted
this with amazement, but I felt the silence was that of stupefaction,
not of indifference and certainly not of rejection. The listeners
were simply stricken dumb. Yet the silence continued, for five, ten,
fifteen, twenty minutes. By then I began to think that Hitler might
have made a mistake, that perhaps his dummy Reichstag was actually
disapproving their idol. Many of them had close friends among
the dead. Then came the breaking point. I think it was the most
dramatic moment in any speech I have ever heard of Hitler’s.</p>

<p>In his intolerably repetitious way he had started with a description
of Germany’s suffering under the Versailles treaty, and under
the “fourteen years of servitude to the traitors of November,” then
sketched the events leading up to the Blood Purge, described his
discovery of the plot against the State, and then with a leap he
shifted into his most passionate style. He had come to the moment
of ordering the executions. Raising his right hand, forefinger
pointed on high, he stood on his toes and roared: “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meine Herren</i>,
at that moment <em>I</em> was the Supreme Court of Germany; <em>I</em> was the
Supreme Judge of Germany; <em>I</em> was Germany!”</p>

<p>The silence in the Reichstag broke, and as though hypnotized,
the 500 Brown-Shirted members roared: “Heil! Heil! Heil!” There,
they had recognized their master. He had spoken as a master. He
had consented again to be their master, and from a mood of bewilderment
and fear they burst into the joyful acknowledgment of
their abasement. Forgotten were the friendships with the dead,
blotted out in the keen pleasure of hearing the crack of the lash.
From then on his lengthy accounting was constantly punctuated
by the traditional applause.</p>

<p>Incidentally it might be pointed out here that there is after
all a very significant difference between the tyrants of long ago
and the tyrants of today. It is a fact that the tyrants of today<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
exercise greater power over the lives of their subjects than any we
can recollect from former times. Historians have to search to find a
Ptolemy, a Caesar, or a Mongol Khan who had so complete a discipline
over their populations, so profound a control over the
individual lives of their subjects as have the despots of the modern
totalitarian states.</p>

<p>But all the modern despots find it necessary to report to their
subjects, to speak and explain, to take them into their alleged confidence,
however mendacious the report may be. They find it
expedient, no matter how they spurn the principles of democracy,
to pretend to treat their subjects as free to exercise a judgment.
Why else does Hitler constantly come before his people to talk?
In the western tyrannies of antiquity and the Middle Ages, in the
European monarchies of divine right and in the Oriental despotisms,
the rulers considered it unnecessary to deliver an accounting to
their people.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that the short experience the world has had
with democracy, not yet two hundred years in duration, has left
with the most imperious ruler a sense of responsibility to the ruled,
or is it merely fear? Hitler despises the masses, I know. But he fears
them also. If Louis <a id="Ref_41" href="#BRef_41">XVI</a> had possessed a fraction of Hitler’s speaking
talent, or King Charles of England, or Czar Nicholas of Russia,
perhaps they might have had a different fate.</p>

<p>In the preface to <cite>Mein Kampf</cite> Hitler indicates the paramount
importance he attaches to the art of political speaking. He wrote:
“I know that one is able to win people far more by the spoken than
by the written word, and that every great movement on this globe
owes its rise to the great speakers and not to the great writers.”
He then wrote a book of 1,000 pages which is said by now to have
been distributed to eight million people, but it was still the spoken
word. He dictated every line of it. You ask, what kind of public
speaker is Hitler? I answer, read <cite>Mein Kampf</cite>.</p>

<p>It reminds me of a man named Korff. Korff was the brains of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Ullstein Verlag, pre-Hitler Germany’s greatest publishing concern.
Korff originated the <cite>Berliner Illustrierte</cite>, first of the world’s great
picture weeklies, forerunner of <cite>Life</cite>, and <cite>Look</cite>, and the French
<cite>Match</cite>. He raised his <cite>Berliner Illustrierte</cite> to more than two million
circulation, undreamed of on the continent before. His salary was
record breaking, his prestige likewise.</p>

<p>One day in 1931, more than a year before Hitler came to power,
Korff came before his board of directors and said, “Gentlemen, I’m
through. I am going to resign. I wish you to release me and to make
your arrangements accordingly.” Astounded, the board asked why.
“Because I’ve read the book, gentlemen,” replied Korff. “What
book?” they asked. “<cite>Mein Kampf</cite>,” Korff said, and began to explain,
but couldn’t on account of the laughter. Dear old Korff had
to have his joke. But no, it was not a joke. Korff resigned, liquidated
his property, got out of Germany and in 1933 when Hitler came to
power the Nazis bought out Ullstein’s at forced sale.</p>

<p>The laughing members of the board and stockholders&mdash;those not
yet dead, shot attempting to escape, or hanged by their belts in
concentration camp&mdash;received a fraction of one per cent of the
value of their holding. Of all the house of Ullstein, only the man
who read the book escaped. I advise you to read the book.</p>

<p>As an orator, Hitler has many superiors. I have mentioned Goebbels
in Germany. Trotzky was certainly better. I heard Trotzky
speak in Moscow the last time he ever appeared on a Russian platform.
It was in 1926. He had been in disgrace for more than a year,
but was allowed to speak on the innocuous theme, “The United
Sates of America and Siberia,” a lecture with paid admissions. The
proceeds were to go to the benefit of needy students of Moscow
University. Why Stalin allowed it I do not know, but he never
permitted a return engagement, for Trotzky’s popularity proved so
great that the mounted police had to be called out to move the
crowds which, despite the exorbitant admission price, jammed the
street before the lecture hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>

<p>I paid thirty roubles for a balcony seat. It was worth the price.
Trotzky appeared, dapper in a light-gray whipcord suit, and
for an hour and a half in Russian which I only faintly understood,
moved me and the three thousand other listeners to intense appreciation
of his forensic talents. I was surprised to hear Trotzky’s voice,
a clear high tenor. I had expected a deeper, more rotund tone. They
said, however, that the clarity of his delivery and its carrying power
were such that he alone among Bolshevik orators could speak in the
Red Square and without a microphone be heard by half a million
listeners. Without being able to understand more than one word
in ten, as at that time I had been in Russia less than a year, I was
nevertheless convinced by this one hearing of Trotzky that he was
one of history’s greatest orators.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What sort of eyes has Hitler? Are they magnetic? What color
are they?</em></p>

<p>A. It seems to depend on who is looking at them. I noticed that
Francis Hackett in his useful book, <cite>What Mein Kampf Means to
America</cite>, cites three descriptions of Hitler’s eyes, all different. Otto
Tolischus calls them “small, greenish brown and almost poetically
introspective eyes.” William D. Bayes calls them “faded blue eyes
between colorless brows and puffy sallow cheeks.” John McCutcheon
Raleigh wrote: “The fanaticism in his eyes was the most
commanding thing about him ... they possess a hypnotic quality
that can easily persuade his followers to do anything the mind
behind the eyes desires.”</p>

<p>These differences evoked from Mr. Hackett the remark: “If you
want to feel discouraged about the art of reporting, consider these
three accounts of Hitler’s eyes.” But what about these additions?
Dorothy Thompson says in her interview, reprinted in <cite>Dictators
and Democrats</cite>: “The eyes alone were notable. Dark gray and
hyperthyroid, they have the peculiar shine which often distinguishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
geniuses, alcoholics and hysterics.” In the same book
Lothrop Stoddard writes: “His eyes are very dark blue.” Likewise,
in the same compilation, I have reported that “He fixed his flat,
non-magnetic, China-blue eyes on me....” I will stick to my version.
His eyes were certainly not magnetic as far as I was concerned,
though I am convinced they would be highly magnetic to any
German. As for the color, they are of such an intermediate, shifting
shade that it may well be they could show in different lights
all the way from greenish brown, faded blue, dark gray, dark blue,
to China blue.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is Hitler really the tough man he claims to be? I remember he
was reported in a recent speech to have remarked: “I am the hardest
man ever to rule Germany.”</em></p>

<p>A. When a man talks too much about his strength, it may mean he
is not so strong after all. Francis Hackett sorted out in his index
of <cite>Mein Kampf</cite> all the references to “Qualities, concepts or practises
Hitler approves,” and to the ones he disapproves. The two
lists throw a good deal of light on Hitler’s character, or rather on
what he thinks his character ought to be.</p>

<p>The things Hitler approves are: First, “Advance by sections,”
by which he means that to achieve, one must concentrate upon one
goal at a time, as he has brilliantly exemplified in his conduct of
the war so far. Then in alphabetic order, Hitler approves: “Brutality;
Discipline; Executions for Treason; Faith; Fanaticism; Force;
Hardness; Idealism; Joy in responsibility; Loyalty; Obedience; Passion;
Perseverance; Ruthlessness; Sacrifice; Self-preservation; Self-sufficiency,
national; Silence and discretion; Social justice; Social
responsibility; Terrorism; Toughness; Will power and determination.”</p>

<p>Hitler condemns: “Cowardice; Eroticism; Half measures; Humaneness;
Liberty; Pacifism; Passive resistance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>

<p>My impression is that of the qualities he named, Hitler possesses
brutality, discipline, faith, fanaticism, force, hardness, idealism,
joy in responsibility, passion, perseverance, ruthlessness, sacrifice,
discretion, terrorism, will power and determination; but that he
does not possess loyalty or a true sense of social justice, or social
responsibility, or toughness. He is hard without being tough. That
is, I believe he will one day prove brittle. As for loyalty, he is
notoriously able to discard a lifelong friend, and if necessary kill
him, as he did Roehm, without visible compunction.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What is the secret of Hitler’s power?</em></p>

<p>A. That is a question that has interested me for eighteen years,
since I first saw Hitler and heard him speak. During all this time
I have heard hundreds of explanations of his power and have
thought of some myself. But the most interesting and plausible discussion
of his personality I have ever heard was given me by Dr.
Carl G. Jung, the great Swiss psychiatrist, when I visited him in
his home in Zurich to ask him to diagnose the dictators. It was in
October 1938, and I had come directly from Prague where I had
witnessed the death of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>Dr. Jung’s analysis of Hitler has been remarkably confirmed by
the events since that time. He had been personally fascinated by
the problem of Hitler’s personality, and had studied it for years.
He said: “There were two types of strong men in primitive society.
One was the chief who was physically powerful, stronger than
all his competitors, and another was the medicine man who was
not strong in himself but was strong by reason of the power which
the people projected into him. Thus we had the Emperor and the
Pope.</p>

<p>“Hitler belongs in the category of the truly mystic medicine man.
His body does not suggest strength. The outstanding characteristic
of his physiognomy is its dreamy look. I was especially struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
by that when I saw pictures taken of him in the Czechoslovakian
crisis; there was in his eyes the look of a seer.”</p>

<p>I asked, “Why is it that Hitler who makes nearly every German
fall down and worship him, produces next to no impression on any
foreigner?”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Dr. Jung assented. “Few foreigners respond at all, yet
apparently every German in Germany does. It is because Hitler is
the mirror of every German’s unconscious, but of course he mirrors
nothing from a non-German.</p>

<p>“He is the loud-speaker which magnifies the inaudible whispers
of the German soul until they can be heard by the German’s
conscious ear. He is the first man to tell every German what he has
been thinking and feeling all along in his unconscious about German
fate, especially since the defeat in the World War, and the one
characteristic which colors every German soul is the typically
German inferiority complex, the complex of the younger brother,
of the one who is always a bit late to the feast. Hitler’s power is
not political; it is <em>magic</em>.</p>

<p>“To understand magic you must understand what the unconscious
is. It is that part of our mental constitution over which we
have little control and which is stored with all sorts of impressions
and sensations; which contains thoughts and even conclusions of
which we are not aware. Besides the conscious impressions which we
receive, there are all sorts of impressions constantly impinging upon
our sense organs of which we do not become aware because they
are too slight to attract our conscious attention. They lie beneath
the threshold of consciousness. But all these subliminal impressions
are recorded; nothing is lost. Someone may be speaking in a faintly
audible voice in the next room while we are talking here. You pay
no attention to it, but the conversation next door is being recorded
in your unconscious as surely as though the latter were a dictaphone
record.</p>

<p>“Now the secret of Hitler’s power is not that Hitler has an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
unconscious more plentifully stored than yours or mine. Hitler’s
secret is twofold; first, that his unconscious has exceptional access
to his consciousness, and second, that he allows himself to be moved
by it. He is like a man who listens intently to a stream of suggestions
in a whispered voice from a mysterious source, and then <em>acts upon
them</em>.</p>

<p>“In our case, even if occasionally our unconscious does reach us
through dreams, we have too much rationality, too much cerebrum
to obey it&mdash;but Hitler listens and obeys. The true leader is always
<em>led</em>.</p>

<p>“We can see it work in him. He himself has referred to his Voice.
His Voice is nothing other than his own unconscious, into which
the German people have projected their own selves; that is, the
unconscious of seventy-eight million Germans. That is what makes
him powerful. Without the German people he would be nothing.
It is literally true when he says that whatever he is able to do is only
because he has the German people behind him, or, as he sometimes
says, because he <em>is</em> Germany. So with his unconscious being the
receptacle of the souls of seventy-eight million Germans, he is
powerful, and with his unconscious perception of the true balance
of political forces at home and in the world, he has so far been
infallible.</p>

<p>“That is why he makes political judgments which turn out to be
right against the opinions of all his advisors and against the opinions
of all foreign observers. When this happens it means only that the
information gathered by his unconscious, and reaching his consciousness
by means of his exceptional talent, has been more nearly
correct than that of all others, German or foreign, who attempted
to judge the situation and who reached conclusions different from
his.”</p>

<p>I remarked that if Hitler’s Voice continued to be always right,
we were in for a very interesting period. This was five months
before Hitler swallowed the whole of Czechoslovakia, and eleven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
months before he launched the Second World War by assaulting
Poland.</p>

<p>Dr. Jung gravely answered: “Yes, it seems that the German
people are now convinced they have found their Messiah. In a way
the position of the Germans is remarkably like that of the Jews of
old.</p>

<p>“Since their defeat in the World War the Germans have awaited
a Messiah, a Savior. That is characteristic of people with an inferiority
complex. The Jews got their inferiority complex from geographical
and political factors. They lived in a part of the world
which was a parade ground for conquerors from both sides, and
after their return from their first exile to Babylon, when they were
threatened with extinction by the Romans, they invented the solacing
idea of a Messiah who was going to bring all the Jews together
into a nation once more and save them.</p>

<p>“The Germans got their inferiority complex from comparable
causes. They came up out of the Danube Valley too late, and
founded the beginnings of their nation long after the French and
English were well on their way to nationhood. They were too late
for the scramble for colonies and for the foundation of empire.
Then when they did get together and made a unified nation, they
looked around them and saw the British, the French, and others
with rich colonies and all the equipment of grown-up nations and
they became jealous, resentful, like a younger brother whose older
brothers have taken the lion’s share of the inheritance.</p>

<p>“So the Germans slept through the division of the world into
colonial empires and thus they got their inferiority complex which
made them want to fight the World War; and of course when they
lost it their feeling of inferiority grew even worse and developed
a desire for a Messiah, and so they have their Hitler. If he is not
their true Messiah, he is like one of the Old Testament prophets;
his mission is to unite his people and lead them to the Promised
Land. This explains why the Nazis have to combat every other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
form of religion besides their own idolatrous brand. I have no doubt
but that the campaign against the Catholic and Protestant churches
will be pursued with relentless and unremitting vigor, for the very
sound reason, from the Nazi point of view, that they wish to substitute
the new faith of Hitlerism.”</p>

<p>I asked Dr. Jung: “Do you consider it possible that Hitlerism
might become for Germany a permanent religion for the future,
like Mohammedanism for the Moslems?”</p>

<p>“I think it is highly possible,” Dr. Jung replied. “Hitler’s ‘religion’
is the nearest to Mohammedanism, realistic, earthy, promising the
maximum of rewards in this life, but with a Moslem-like Valhalla
into which worthy Germans may enter and continue to enjoy
themselves. Like Mohammedanism, it teaches the <em>virtue</em> of the
sword. Hitler’s first idea is to make his people powerful because the
spirit of the Aryan German deserves to be supported by might, by
muscle and steel. It is not a spiritual religion in the sense in which
we ordinarily use the term. But remember that in the early days of
Christianity it was the church which made the claim to total power,
both spiritual and temporal. Today the church no longer makes
this claim, but the claim has been taken over by the totalitarian
states which demand not only temporal but spiritual power.</p>

<p>“Incidentally it occurs to me that the religious character of Hitlerism
is also emphasized by the fact that the German communities
throughout the world far from the political power of Berlin, have
adopted Hitlerism. Look at South America.”</p>

<p>Dr. Jung said he had closely observed Hitler at his meeting with
Mussolini in Berlin. “I was only a few yards away from the two
men and could study them well. In comparison with Mussolini,
Hitler made upon me the impression of a sort of scaffolding of
wood covered with cloth, an automaton with a mask, like a robot
or a mask of a robot. During the whole performance he never
laughed; it was as though he were in a bad humor, sulking. He
showed no human sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<p>“His expression was that of an inhumanly single-minded purposiveness,
with no sense of humor. He seemed as if he might be a
double of a real person, and that Hitler the man might perhaps be
hiding inside like an appendix, and deliberately so hiding in order
not to disturb the mechanism.</p>

<p>“With Hitler you do not feel that you are with a man. You are
with a medicine man, a form of spiritual vessel, a demi-deity, or
even better, a myth. With Hitler you are scared. You know you
would never be able to talk to that man; because there is nobody
there. He is not a man, but a collective. He is not an individual,
but a whole nation. I take it to be literally true that he has no personal
friend. How can you talk intimately with a nation?”</p>

<p>Finally Dr. Jung delivered a prophecy which was to prove woefully
accurate just five months later. “England and France,” he
said, “will not honor their new guarantee to Czechoslovakia any
more than France honored her previous pledge to Czechoslovakia.
No nation keeps its word. A nation is a big, blind worm, following
what? Fate perhaps. A nation has no honor, it has no word to keep.
That is the reason why in the old days, they tried to have kings
who did possess personal honor, and a word. But you know if you
choose one hundred of the most intelligent people and get them
all together, they are a stupid mob? Ten thousand of them together
would have the collective intelligence of an alligator. Haven’t you
noticed at a dinner party that the more people you invite the more
stupid the conversation? In a crowd, the qualities which everybody
possesses multiply, pile up, and become the dominant characteristics
of the whole crowd.</p>

<p>“Not everybody has virtues, but everybody has the low animal
instincts, the basic primitive caveman suggestibility, the suspicious
and vicious traits of the savage. The result is that when you get a
nation of many millions of people, it is not even human. It is a
lizard or a crocodile, or a wolf. Its statesmen cannot have a higher
morality than the animal-like mass morality of the nation, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
individual statesmen of the democratic states may attempt to
behave a little better. For Hitler, however, more than for any
other statesman in the modern world, it would be impossible to
expect that he should keep the word of Germany against her interest,
in any international bargain, agreement, or treaty. Because
Hitler is the nation.”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Isn’t there anything constructive about Hitlerism? Is it all
destructive? Won’t they get over their period of madness and
settle down and make good world citizens?</em></p>

<p>A. In 1934 I talked with President Thomas G. Masaryk of
Czechoslovakia in the old Hradzin Palace in Prague. The venerable
statesman was eighty-four years old, but he was still able to deliver
measured philosophical replies. One of them was to the question:
“Aren’t you as head of the Republic of Czechoslovakia which
Hitler and his Nazis threaten so violently, afraid he may some day
attack you?” The old man slowly replied, “No, because every
revolutionary movement such as the Nazis’ has its period of ecstasy,
and the Nazis are going through theirs now, but in a little while
more they will subside and we will be able to get along peaceably
with them.”</p>

<p>I went away with my first example of the fact that no man over
seventy ever seems to be able to understand Hitler. I beg the pardon
of the grand exception, Senator Glass, whose early and persistent
advocacy of effective action against Hitler has distinguished
him among Senators, some of whom approach treason in their
imbecilic refusal to comprehend the life-and-death issue facing
America.</p>

<p>Just five years after the founder of Czechoslovakia had expressed
his faith in the fundamental normality of the Nazis, his conviction
that they were after all like other people, and that their revolution
would follow the natural course of other radical movements and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
become stabilized, Hitler sat at the very desk in the Hradzin where
Masaryk had sat. Czechoslovakia had ceased to exist precisely
because Masaryk and all the other heads of states in Europe blindly
refused to see that in Hitlerism the world was faced with a brute
which always had to move forward, steadily became bigger and
hungrier as it was fed, and would never cease to destroy and
devour until stopped by force. To the German there is something
mystically attractive about this Nazi Wave of Destruction. They
feel their fate is being achieved by violence so fierce that it intoxicates
them, as the young Nazi Shock Troops are intoxicated by
battle lust when they fling themselves upon the enemy.</p>

<p>It is the Nazis’ ability to combine this berserk, mystic rage with
cold scientific mastery of the intricate instruments of mechanized
war that makes them so formidable. They even loot scientifically,
as witness the way they have bled France. I know an amusing and
typical example of the German’s aptitude for plundering profitably.</p>

<p>In Spain I met a young German Nazi machine gunner serving
with Franco. His name was Franz, and he had been an SS officer
in Duesseldorf. He had come to Spain, he declared, for idealistic
motives, to fight the Bolsheviks, and now after three months’ service
his idealism had been rewarded with a small fortune. I asked
him how he had been able to make any money serving as a noncommissioned
officer.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he explained, “I have the advantage over these Spaniards
and Moors of having an academic education. I did not finish school
but I had enough <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Naturwissenschaft</i> to know my way about in a
physics or chemistry laboratory. Now what do these poor ignorant
Spaniards and Moors do when they enter a town we have just
taken. They go busting around breaking into homes and offices,
looking for cash and jewelry and such things, but nobody ever
leaves cash and jewelry lying around. What do I do? I go straight
to the <em>Kino</em>, the motion picture theater, and straight to the projection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
room, and there I remove the lenses which are worth from ten
to twenty thousand pesetas, and I put the lenses in my suitcase
when I get back, and now I have two suitcases full of lenses. They
are worth a fortune. You see the beauties of education?”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How has Hitler run his show without money, without gold,
without foreign exchange? Can the Nazi economy continue to run
indefinitely on its present basis?</em></p>

<p>A. The Nazi economy can continue to run only as long as the war
lasts. This is the economic compulsion on Hitler to go on fighting.
The Nazi economy is one of scarcity. There are not enough
workers, since most able-bodied men are in the army; not enough
food, or clothing, or fuel, or manufactured articles. Everybody not
in the armed forces has to work very hard, very long hours in
order to feed the colossal war machine and produce the minimum
necessary for the civilians to subsist. Scarcity would normally
shove prices upward; but not in the Nazi economy where the
Terror makes price control really work. The Gestapo is a more
potent backing for the currency than gold. The workings of a
totalitarian economy seem queer to us only because we continue to
think of Adam Smith’s “economic man,” and because we still
believe that man will always act freely in accord with the law of
supply and demand. But man under the Nazis is not free, does not
act according to the law of supply and demand but according to
the Nazi law. This compulsion by Terror makes a different kind
of economic unit of him; our economic laws do not apply to him
any more. In our bourgeois society when civil law condemns a man
to go hungry, appetite is likely to make him break the law. In the
totalitarian state the punishments of the concentration camp subdue
almost every impulse to rebel.</p>

<p>For foreign trade the Nazis use an infinitely flexible, complex
system of barter, often three-way. They confidently assert they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
have outgrown the use of gold; although one of the reasons Walther
Darre advanced for a Nazi conquest of America was to lay hands
on the American gold reserve at Fort Knox. The Nazis have
demonstrated that they can do without gold, but this is no proof
that gold is not more convenient than barter; it is proof only that
anything can be used for money as long as the people believe in it,
by natural inclination or by compulsion&mdash;wampum, cows, brass,
paper, or the muzzle of a Gestapo pistol. It is one of our commonest
fallacies to believe that financial considerations affect very
much the beginning or the middle or the end of a war. Can you
recall any war that had to stop because one side ran out of money?
In wartime a nation becomes a collective and money a mere bookkeeping
item. Only after the war when accounts are presented,
does bankruptcy become real. Hitler inherited a bankrupt, bourgeois,
peacetime economy and turned it overnight, from the
moment he came to power in 1933, into a wartime economy. Real
peace would mean the total collapse of Hitler’s totalitarian economic
machine.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why do the Nazis call theirs the Third Reich?</em></p>

<p>A. Historically the First Reich was the Holy Roman Empire, the
second was the one founded by Bismarck, and the third is Hitler’s.
When I discussed this once with Dr. Jung, he pointed out deeper
meanings. He said, “Nobody called Charlemagne’s kingdom the
First Reich, nor William’s the Second Reich. Only the Nazis call
theirs the Third Reich, because it has a profound <em>mystical</em> meaning.”</p>

<p>Dr. Jung said the Nazis feel a parallel between the Biblical triad,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and the <em>Third</em> Reich, and that in
fact many Nazis refer to Hitler as the Holy Ghost. “Again,” Dr.
Jung continued, “consider the widespread revival in the Third
Reich of the cult of Wotan, God of Wind. Take the name <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sturmabteilung</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
Storm Troops. The swastika is a revolving form making
a vortex moving ever toward the left&mdash;which means in Buddhistic
symbolism sinister, unfavorable, directed toward the unconscious.
All these symbols of a Third Reich led by its prophet under the
banners of wind and storm and whirling vortices point to a mass
movement which is to sweep the German people in a hurricane of
unreasoning emotion on to a destiny which perhaps none but the
seer, the prophet, the Fuehrer himself can foretell&mdash;and perhaps
not even he.”</p>

<p>This psychiatric explanation of the Nazi names and symbols
may sound to a layman fantastic, but can anything be as fantastic
as the bare facts about the Nazi Party and its Fuehrer? Be sure
there is much more to be explained in them than can be explained
by merely calling them gangsters. They are products of that most
hysterical, illogical, emotional mentality in Europe, the German.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But I thought the Germans were stolid, phlegmatic, sensible
people. How can you describe them as hysterical?</em></p>

<p>A. The commonest mistake the outside world makes about the
Germans is to describe them the way you have done. We Americans
seem to have judged most European nations exactly opposite
from what they really are. We consider the Italian to be emotional,
easily swayed, the Frenchman to be volatile, the Spaniard passionate,
and so on. Well, all the Latin races are models of calm, common
sense and middle-of-the-road, essentially stable people compared
with the Germans. As Dr. Jung put it, “The Italians are stable.
Their minds do not roll and wallow and leap and plunge through
all the extravagant ecstasies which are the daily exercise of the
German mind.” The Germans carry everything to excess.</p>

<p>What other nation in Europe would have been inundated in one
decade by a wave of hysteria which was to sweep them into idolatrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
worship of a former building-trades laborer and corporal
and lift them into conquest of the entire continent of Europe and
promise the conquest of the world? Surely this is the most extraordinary
yielding by a great people to a mass emotion ever observed
in our so-called civilized world.</p>

<p>It is not, however, the first time that similar things have happened
in Germany. Hitler has had some notable predecessors in the
turbulent period of the Reformation.</p>

<p>The Anabaptists of Munster were forerunners of the Nazis, and
their Fuehrer, John of Leyden, was a figure comparable to Hitler
in ambition and in his mystic hold over his followers. Leyden and
his associates seized the city of Munster in Westphalia in 1532 and,
establishing a totalitarian theocracy, set out to conquer the world
and make Munster its capital. Is that any more or less fantastic than
Adolf Hitler, setting out to proceed from Munich to the conquest
of the world?</p>

<p>John of Leyden differed in one respect, however, from Hitler.
He not only encouraged polygamy as Hitler’s Black Guards encourage
promiscuity, but he had four wives of his own, one of
whom he, in a typically Hitlerian fit of rage, beheaded with his
own hand in the market place. Munster for three years was the
scene of excesses, profligacy, and inhuman tortures committed
upon the foes of the medieval Nazis, until they were finally overcome
by a coalition of outraged neighbors, comparable in a smaller
way, one might say, to the present coalition against the Third
Reich.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Doesn’t the life of Hitler, as far as we know it, show that he
suffered very much from poverty in his youth and then when
Germany was defeated, he suffered along with his fellow Germans
so deeply that we ought to be able to understand and forgive
instead of hating and making war upon him?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>A. That seems the equivalent of appealing for sympathy and
understanding for a mad dog, because the poor dog had been bitten
and given rabies without wanting it. It was not his fault, and he
had suffered from it, so why shoot him? Hitler, we know, did suffer
as a youth from many disabilities, including extreme poverty,
and we ought to be sorry that he did, not merely as Christians
from love of our neighbor, but because Hitler is causing us such
infinite trouble and misery, partially perhaps, on account of these
early discomforts.</p>

<p>But we can do nothing to correct Hitler’s personal history. By
the time he came into our lives his character was fixed in rigid,
implacable hatred for every human being on earth not willing or
suitable to help him place Deutschland in command of the world
with himself the globe’s supreme ruler. He is as little susceptible to
reformation today as a rattlesnake. As for the German people and
their sufferings after the defeat in the last war, there are several
things to say.</p>

<p>First, they did not suffer nearly so much as a nation usually
suffers after losing a four-years’ war. I can testify to that from personal
observation of the Germans from 1923 on, a period including
the most desperate months of the inflation. It is simply not correct
to say as Hackett says about the Germans after the war, “They
were just as unhappy, as despairing and as demoralized, in the
midst of their Reconstruction Period, as the old South in the years
after the Civil War.”</p>

<p>The old South was physically devastated by the war. Germany
surrendered before the enemy reached her territory; she came off
materially scot-free. The people of the old South felt permanently
beaten and for a long time hopeless because they had failed in their
attempt to defend their right to be independent. The people of
Germany felt temporarily frustrated of their ambition to dominate
the world; just twenty years later they set forth to try it again. Do
you think the old South, if it had wanted to do so, would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
been able physically or economically to have resumed the struggle
with the North in 1885, twenty years after the end of the Civil
War, as the Germans did with the Allies in 1939, twenty years
after Versailles?</p>

<p>My second point about the German suffering is that before
Versailles they demonstrated their intention in the treaties of
Bucharest and Brest-Litovsk, to inflict upon their enemies terms
incomparably more severe than Versailles.</p>

<p>Third, in the course of the present war the Germans have
proved that the sort of peace they intend to grant the countries
they vanquish now will make the Versailles treaty appear to be a
dispensation from Heaven.</p>

<p>Fourth, although these facts do not of course excuse the flaws
in the Versailles treaty, none of its defects could possibly excuse
the bestial behavior of the Germans toward the especial objects of
their pathological antipathy, the Jews, Czechs, and Poles, nor provide
a reasonable basis for their desire to inflict vengeance upon
the entire world.</p>

<p>Finally, it makes no difference what the reasons for present
German behavior are, that behavior threatens to destroy us and
unless we check it by force, we shall perish.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What should we do with Hitler after we beat him? Will he
be allowed to escape to a lifetime of comfort the way Kaiser
Wilhelm did?</em></p>

<p>A. When this question is asked I am reminded of an old Texas
recipe for cooking rabbit. It begins, “First catch your rabbit.”
I do not know what will be done with Hitler. There are many
people who say he will never be taken alive; that he will commit
suicide. I do not believe that. My guess is that Hitler would either
“do a Hess” and escape to England or seek death in battle as the
Kaiser once claimed he would do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p>If he remains alive, our people being incurably sentimental, we
should probably treat him the way the Allies treated Napoleon
after Leipzig. They sent him, as you may remember, to Elbe, and
gave him an annual income of 2,000,000 francs, which was about
$400,000 and equivalent to $1,000,000 in purchasing power today.
Perhaps we would not, though, especially if the American people
have to live through a great deal of hardship and bloodletting on
account of this man. Maybe we will become like the British, who,
after all, are going to have something to say about the fate of
Hitler if and when he is ever caught.</p>

<p>The <cite>Daily Mail</cite> of London ran a questionnaire asking its readers
what they thought should be done with Hitler after the war. The
largest number, twenty-five per cent, wanted him shown about
the country in a cage. This is an idea which had been suggested for
the former Kaiser, and it shows a surprising insight into the source
of the deepest emotions for extremely vain men of the type of
Hitler and the Kaiser; they certainly would suffer more from such
public humiliation than from any other punishment.</p>

<p>Another twenty per cent wanted him executed by hanging,
shooting, or beheading, in that order. Fifteen per cent wanted him
exiled to remote, unpleasant places, as Devil’s Island, the Andaman
Islands, Ascension Island, Arctic wastes, and the African desert.
Another fifteen per cent wanted him condemned to lifelong solitary
confinement. Ten per cent wanted to make him live the rest of
his life under the same conditions the English are living under
now, with bombs, rationing, and so on. Five per cent wanted to
hand him over to the Poles or Jews. Five per cent would have him
treated as a certified lunatic.</p>

<p>Five per cent suggested all sorts of miscellaneous treatment,
including confinement under precisely the same conditions as
normally obtain in a Nazi torture chamber. There were no suggestions
at all that he should be treated well, as Napoleon was
treated. The question is not trivial and the answers of the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
are really important, because they throw light on the temper of
the British people after the brutal manhandling they have received
from Nazi bombers. The most constructive suggestion I ever heard
on the subject of what to do with Hitler came from my brilliant
friend, Edgar Mowrer, who had a decade of experience in Germany.
He suggests that after we have defeated Hitler we put
him in a cage and send him about Germany to explain to the
Germans how wrong he had been.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What would happen if Hitler were to be killed?</em></p>

<p>A. It would reduce the German war effort by one-half, and would
guarantee that Germany would lose. Hitler is irreplaceable, unique,
and if he were to be killed, or died, or anyhow left the scene, Germany
would not collapse but she would be as an automobile going
at top speed, suddenly run out of gasoline. The momentum of the
car would carry it forward a certain distance, but it would eventually
stop.</p>

<p>That, in my opinion, is what would happen to Germany if
deprived of Hitler. It is not his technical ability that would be
missed so much, nor his administrative brains, nor even his incredibly
accurate, intuitive knowledge of his enemies, nor even his
uncanny sense of timing. What would be missed would be his
inspiration to the German people. If they lost their medicine man
the faith in his name would flicker on, but the confidence in his
infallibility which now upholds the civil population in the hardships
of war and promotes the courage of the troops in battle
would disappear. The effect would be disastrous.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why doesn’t somebody kill Hitler?</em></p>

<p>A. For the last two years that has been the question most frequently
asked me on the lecture platform all over America. Sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
a fourth of all the written questions sent up would be this
one. An average of twenty-five persons out of every thousand in
the audience would put this question and they have been doing
that ever since Hitler’s victory over the Allies in Munich in September
1938. This itself is an interesting light on the American
attitude. Most of the time the question was framed, “Why doesn’t
some Jew, or some Britisher, or some Frenchman kill Hitler?”</p>

<p>It is bewildering to reflect that up until September 1939, any
young man, Jew or Gentile, British, French, or of any of the
thirteen nations Hitler has conquered, any brave, intelligent man
could have killed Hitler within two months of making the resolution
to do so. Only one requirement was essential&mdash;that the assassin
be willing to give up his life. Now, however, it may cost the lives
of millions of young men on the battlefield before this author of
evil is destroyed.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But wasn’t he always too closely guarded to be killed?</em></p>

<p>A. Not at all. Now it is another matter. Since the war began he is
so well guarded that it might be impossible to get at him. Before
the war began it would have been easy to kill him. It might even
have been possible for a bold and shrewd assassin to have killed
him without being captured. I give you one instance.</p>

<p>At every Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg there are hundreds
of thousands of strangers in the city. The Gestapo with all
its resources cannot possibly check on them all. A resourceful
foreigner, speaking German and posing as a German, could obtain
a room in a hotel facing the main street down which the parades
pass. During the course of the Congress Hitler appears in at least
one parade a day down this street. He always uses a long black
Mercedes car and he stands in the front, next to his chauffeur.
Hitler stands there holding on now and then with his left hand,
and giving the Nazi salute with his right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span></p>

<p>In the rear of his car are four SS men, and on the running boards
are two others, and behind Hitler’s car is another identical Mercedes
with six to eight more SS men. The SS men, who are the
best pistol shots in Germany, lean out of their cars, peering at the
crowds, and they keep their right hands always on their pistols.
You say that sounds as though he were well guarded? Not at all.
The crowd in Nuremberg is so great that it encroaches on the path
of the automobiles until they are slowed to a walk. That means
Hitler passes underneath your window at a walking speed.</p>

<p>An assassin could lean out of his window and toss a bomb into
Hitler’s car with absolute accuracy. He could not miss. I have
often leaned out and looked down at Hitler and remarked in a
whisper to my comrades, “How easy it would be, wouldn’t it, to
drop a grapefruit?” And if you think a bomb is too uncertain, why
not try a sub-machine gun? That would be 100 per cent sure. You
would have him at a distance of about thirty yards. With one burst
you could riddle him, put perhaps twenty bullets into him before
the guards could turn around.</p>

<p>You ask how the assassin could get the sub-machine gun or the
bombs into the hotel? The Gestapo is good, but it is a long way
from being perfect. They overlook a great many things. We were
in Vienna when Hitler marched in. The Gestapo had been in
control of the city for days. But on the very day Hitler came to
Vienna my wife borrowed a radio set from Tess Shirer and had
the porter carry it into the hotel and up to our room. It was the
size of a large thick suitcase. Nobody stopped her, or asked to
investigate it. It might have contained two or three sub-machine
guns with sufficient ammunition and a few hand grenades.</p>

<p>You object that the assassin would certainly be caught and executed.
I agree. Political assassins almost never escape. But political
assassins must always and nearly always are willing to take this
chance. You can take it as a rule of political assassination, however,
that if the assassin is bold enough, he can always get his man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Remember the Macedonian gunman, Vlada Georgiev, who killed
King Alexander and Louis Barthou in Marseilles, October 9, 1934?
He was a husky fellow who waited behind the police line until the
royal automobile came opposite him and then burst through the
line like a football player and with one leap was on the running
board of the automobile pumping bullets from his automatic into
his two victims. It was all over in thirty seconds. The police had
no chance to intervene before Alexander was dead. General
Georges, later the unhappy second in command of the French
Army, cut down the assassin with his saber.</p>

<p>This is the classic street assassination, resembling in every detail
the killing by Gavril Princip of the Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand in
Sarajevo, June 28, 1914, which touched off the first World War.
But the Nuremberg situation would give an assassin a chance for
his life. You see, the SS guards are constantly watching the crowds
in the street. None of them pays attention to the windows of the
houses and hotels along the street. The crowds are so thick that
between our hotel and the path of Hitler’s automobile would be
standing twenty to thirty thousand people.</p>

<p>Now suppose the assassin drops his bomb or fires his machine
gun, or to make assurance doubly sure, drops bombs <em>and</em> fires his
machine gun. Hitler falls. The crowd panics. How long would it
take the SS men or other police to get through the crowd to the
hotel entrance, climb the stairs, and search for the assassin? It
would take several minutes at least. And in the midst of that howling
mob of panic-stricken people it would take minutes more
before the police could surround the block. Meanwhile the assassin
would have plenty of time to run upstairs to the roof, across to
another building, and down a rear fire escape to mingle with the
crowd. Whatever the later details of escape, there would be a
chance of his getting away from the scene of the shooting if he
had laid his plans carefully in advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You haven’t told us yet why nobody ever tried it?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, it has been clumsily tried, but without the proper preparation.
Four or five attempts were made on Hitler’s life during his
first two years in office, 1933 and 1934, while I was in Berlin. They
were all hushed up so closely that we never had more than the
skeleton of the story. They were hushed up because the Nazis and
especially the Gestapo, and especially its chief, Heinrich Himmler,
know that there is nothing so infectious as the idea of political
assassination.</p>

<p>The news of an attempt at assassination will set off a series of
imitative attempts. Therefore Himmler gave up his original idea
which was expressed in his announcement through the German
press a few weeks after Hitler took office. Himmler declared in a
formal proclamation that if anyone were to assassinate or attempt
to assassinate the Fuehrer, there would be, and these are his exact
words, “a massacre such as the world has never seen.” He specified
that the Gestapo would massacre all of the Nazis’ opponents, and
implied they would kill every Jew in Germany.</p>

<p>Himmler’s announcement was calculated to deter assassins, but
he never meant to put it into effect unless Hitler were actually
killed. We correspondents, however, heard of several attempts on
Hitler. One was said to have taken place the day before the great
Blood Purge of June 30, 1934, and was believed to have contributed
to Hitler’s decision to exterminate his enemies. In this case
the assassin fired with a rifle at Hitler’s automobile. Another time
his car was narrowly saved from crashing into an obstacle supposed
to have been placed in the road with the purpose of killing
him. Other attempts were even more vaguely rumored. Himmler
took care that the public should learn nothing about these attempts,
not only because of the infectious nature of the news of the assassinations,
but because the Gestapo considered it undesirable to
reveal that anybody in Germany could want to kill the Fuehrer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>That’s all right about Germans, but why not a Britisher, or a
Frenchman, or a Jew?</em></p>

<p>A. The question why doesn’t a Jew, or why didn’t a Jew, kill
Hitler is one that I have often heard asked of my Jewish friends,
and the answer usually is that if a Jew killed Hitler the Nazis would
slaughter every Jew in their dominions. The Nazis now have under
their despotism in the Reich and the fifteen conquered countries
perhaps five or six million Jews still. I agree that it is perfectly possible
that the Nazis might try to slaughter them all if a Jew were
to kill Hitler, but if Hitler is not defeated these unfortunate victims
of Nazi hatred will ultimately perish anyway.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even the very courageous young Jews who used to
operate an organization to counter Arab terror argued the same
way with me when I was in Palestine, that if they killed Hitler they
would doom hundreds of thousands if not millions of Jews to death.
It seems that they can believe rationally that Hitler does intend
eventually to exterminate all the Jews in Europe, and so it would
not make much difference if they were all or many of them killed
as a result of Hitler’s assassination, but emotionally they cling to
the subconscious hope that something will happen to save them.
Of course, the only thing that can save the Jews of Europe is for
Hitler to be defeated before they all die.</p>

<p>As for a young Britisher or Frenchman killing Hitler, before
the war began, as I have said, it would have been easy, but consider
if a man had killed Hitler before the war, what would the world
have said? What sort of judgment would the world have delivered
on the assassin? Would he have been considered a hero, a savior of
mankind? Not at all, because Hitler up to that time was only a
potential menace to Britain, France, and the other peaceful states.
If he had been killed, his assassin would have been declared a madman,
and his act would have been condemned by all save the small
group of persons who perceived the inevitability and the catastrophic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
course of the war Hitler planned against the world. No
assassin kills out of pure idealism. A man who killed Hitler would
want a little credit for it, and until the war began he would have
received none.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>He would receive plenty of credit now. Why doesn’t the
British government organize the killing of Hitler? Haven’t they
plenty of agents in Germany?</em></p>

<p>A. I have no doubt the killer of Hitler would be decorated by
fifteen governments or more, but there are still millions of muddled
sentimentalists in this country who would shudder at the thought
of assassination. There were few, I suppose, who objected to the
G-men shooting the rabid Dillinger, but millions denounced the
little doctor, Weiss, who shot the far more dangerous criminal,
Huey Long. So it would have fared with anyone who would have
assassinated Hitler. Imagine how different the history of Germany
and of the world might have been if Hitler had been among the
victims of the machine gun which fired on him on the morning of
November 10, 1923, on the Odeon’s Platz in Munich.</p>

<p>Before this war there were just as many sentimentalists in England,
but you would have to look a long time to find one now.
During an air raid in London I asked an old English lady, one of the
gentlest creatures I have ever known, what she would do if she
were driving an automobile and suddenly Hitler were to appear
in front of the car. Would she turn and save him, or would she
drive ahead and hit him? “I would press the accelerator and drive
straight over him,” she said firmly.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What was the explanation of the bombing attempt on Hitler in
the Munich Beer Hall?</em></p>

<p>A. It bore every earmark of being an admirably well thought-out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
and executed plan by the British which just failed by a few
minutes. I should think the British government has done all it could
to have Hitler killed. Certainly the British know how supremely
important it would be to do away with the heart and brains of
Nazidom. The bomb attempt on Hitler in the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Buergerbraeu Keller</i>
in Munich, November 8, 1939, the anniversary of the Hitler-Ludendorff
Putsch, nearly succeeded. To refresh your memory:
Hitler and his “Old Fighters” left the beer hall twelve minutes
before a time bomb exploded, killing seven persons and wounding
sixty-three. The Germans blamed it on the British secret agents,
and announced they had captured two such agents, a Mr. Best and
a Captain Stevens, on the day after the bomb explosion.</p>

<p>The Gestapo had gone over into Holland to kidnap the two
Britishers who incautiously made a rendezvous close to the frontier.</p>

<p>Some persons analyzed this affair thus: The Gestapo itself
arranged the bomb to go off after Hitler left. The Gestapo did it
for one of two reasons. Either Himmler wanted to kill Hitler, or
Hitler wanted the bomb attempt in order to arouse sympathy for
himself among his people, and hatred of the English. Neither of
these explanations makes sense to me. No Nazi leader in his right
mind wants Hitler to be killed, because every Nazi is aware that his
party, his job, and his very life are dependent upon the continued
existence and leadership of Hitler. I will not say anything further
about the plain fact that most of Hitler’s subordinates literally worship
him. Just on the basis of individual self-interest, it would be
unlikely that any Nazi leader should wish to weaken the Nazi
position so disastrously.</p>

<p>I do not believe Himmler or any other Nazi was behind the
attempt. Nor is it credible that Hitler planted the bomb to arouse
sympathy for himself among the German people. He has all the
sympathy he needs, and German hatred for the English is quite
adequate. Neither of these two reasons could balance the danger
involved in the infectious quality of a public attempt at assassination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
such as this was. This attempt, which took place before a large public,
could not be concealed.</p>

<p>Finally, it seems that the German capture of the two British
secret agents crippled the British Intelligence Service in Germany
for many months. They were men high in the service and could be
presumed to have known a good deal about the whole Intelligence
Service setup in Germany. With the Gestapo at work on them in
the approved style recently made so vivid and bloodcurdling by
Jan Valtin in <cite>Out of the Night</cite>, it is not likely that many British
Intelligence agents in Germany remained unidentified. At any rate
there have not been any further attempts on Hitler, at least none
that we know about.</p>

<p>The time-bomb attempt was compared by some correspondents
to the Reichstag fire, but I fail to see the basis for comparison. The
Reichstag was set afire by the Nazis for the specific, rational purpose
of blaming it on the Communists, suppressing their party, jailing
their deputies, and thus obtaining for the Nazis a majority vote
in the Reichstag. These purposes were achieved to the great profit
of the Nazis. What profit could the Nazis have had in staging a
near assassination of Hitler? When the Reichstag was burned, my
cabled report was censored, the first censorship I had experienced
in eight years of work as a correspondent in Germany.</p>

<p>The freshly appointed censor cut out a paragraph in which I had
pointed out that police when seeking the perpetrator of a crime,
always try to find out first who would have profited by the crime.
So in the case of the Reichstag fire it was only necessary to look
for the persons who would profit by the fire. The answer was as
plain as daylight. Only the Nazis would profit by the fire. The
censor deleted this commonplace but accurate observation. Who
would profit by the death of Hitler? The Nazis? Of course not.
The British? Of course! If they had succeeded they would have
earned the thanks of a thousand million beneficiaries throughout the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<p>The fact that Hitler and his staff saved their lives by leaving the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Buergerbraeu Keller</i> earlier than had been their custom in former
years is the basis of the peculiar claim that the whole thing was a
Nazi plot. Why, it is argued, should Hitler have not stayed as
usual to chat with the comrades of the early days? Why indeed?
Because this was wartime, the first anniversary of the Putsch to be
celebrated since the war began. Hitler has not been known to waste
much time since the war began. He could be assumed to have had
a number of things to do more important than chatting with his
Beer Cellar veterans. This time his industry saved his life.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why is it there are so few assassinations or attempted assassinations
in any of the totalitarian states? You would think their cruelties
would lead many desperate men to seek revenge.</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, you would, and this is a matter that many of us in Russia
used to discuss. How odd it was that in the history of the Soviet
Union there were only three known assassinations or attempts at
assassination of Soviet leaders.</p>

<p>Lenin was shot and seriously wounded in 1918 by Dora Kaplan,
a Social Revolutionary; Uritzky, police chief of Leningrad, was
killed at the same time; and sixteen years later, December 4, 1934,
Sergei Kirov, political boss of Leningrad, was shot by a half-demented
former Communist, Nikolaev. I shall not forget the Kirov
killing because I was in Moscow at the time and saw Stalin, in the
bitter cold of a Moscow December, help carry barehanded the
coffin of Kirov to its grave on the Red Square, and then hurry back
to his office to plan his revenge, the most colossal ever enjoyed by a
human being since the prophet wrote that vengeance was reserved
to the Almighty.</p>

<p>It was the Kirov killing, of course, which touched off Stalin’s
great purge. It illustrates perfectly the first of several reasons why
assassinations are rare in the totalitarian states. Let me say here that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
one of those reasons is not the one most popularly believed. It is not
due to the impenetrable guard kept around the tyrants. There at
the funeral of Kirov, we in the press box were not more than
twenty yards from Stalin as he stood on top of Lenin’s tomb, and
when he walked to the grave he came within almost touching distance
of me.</p>

<p>Granted that the correspondents have unusual facilities, and that
the G.P.U. checks all of them to be confident none of them is dangerous.
But there in the Red Square hundreds of thousands of men
and women marched past Stalin, the nearest only a few feet away.
Any one of them could have shot at him or hurled a hand grenade
at him before any of the police surrounding the tomb could have
intervened.</p>

<p>Likewise, Stalin could have been killed any time during the two
decades by any person with the initiative to attend the Bolshoi
Theater when Stalin was there, sitting in the rear of his first floor
forward box. He could have been shot from a score of seats in the
first two rows of the orchestra. It would have been even easier to
wait for one of the big Communist meetings in the Bolshoi Theater
when Stalin was there with all the leaders of the party. I have seen
him with the entire Politburo and forty or fifty others, sitting
bunched together on the stage of the Bolshoi Theater, while we in
the Press box in the Gallery, almost overhanging the stage, leaned
over the rail and quietly observed how easy it would be to drop
something in Stalin’s lap.</p>

<p>A single bomb small enough to be concealed beneath an overcoat
would have killed Stalin and perhaps the entire top rank of the
Communist Party. Why hasn’t anyone tried it? Stalin surely has
more enemies who would like to see him dead than any man in the
world except Hitler. Stalin probably has more personal enemies
than Hitler, because Stalin has executed more people. When you
think of the millions who died as victims of the Revolution, and of
the millions who died in the famine of 1932-33, when Stalin ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
the peasants of the Ukraine to be stripped of all their food to
teach them a lesson, it seems singular that no bereaved survivor
should have lifted his hand against the tyrant.</p>

<p>The first reason, however, why a modern despot enjoys relative
security is the character of totalitarian terror. In a normal democratic
country an assassin has to fear only the loss of his own life,
and the lives of his immediate conspirators, if any. In Russia, after
Kirov’s death, Stalin executed in this wise:</p>

<p>First, 103 persons who were not even accused of having had anything
to do with the assassination but had been held in jail for
various political offenses. This was simply the first gesture of the
Terror, intended to shock the country. Then as the police rounded
up Nikolaev’s family, friends, and acquaintances, and read his diary,
they came to know virtually every human being Nikolaev had
known during his whole life. Every one of these persons was arrested
and after being squeezed dry of information was executed;
at any rate they all disappeared.</p>

<p>But that was only the beginning. The purges which were occasioned,
not caused, by the Kirov killing lasted about four years,
from 1935 to 1938 inclusive. The Purge became so huge that
Nikolaev was forgotten, but before the G.P.U. finished with the
Nikolaev complex, they had liquidated in this wise: Every relative
of Nikolaev to the third cousins; every acquaintance of Nikolaev
and every acquaintance of an acquaintance of Nikolaev, and every
acquaintance of every acquaintance of every acquaintance of
Nikolaev. You think this is an exaggeration? Not at all. The number
of executions ran into thousands.</p>

<p>Now what would be the effect upon a would-be assassin, if, as
he contemplated his deed, he reflected that as a consequence of his
killing Stalin, not merely would he himself be executed, but every
human being in the world with whom he had ever come in contact?
Man experiences the world largely as a series of contacts with other
men. Suppose the assassin knew by just such an experience as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Russian people had in the case of the killing of Kirov, that his entire
world would be blotted out if he went on with his plans. Would
not this deter almost any man?</p>

<p>He might be motivated by the highest idealism, and would plan
to give his own life in order to rid his country of a cruel despot, but
if he were thinking of helping the people in his own world he
would be bound to admit that far from helping them, he was about
to condemn to death everybody on earth he had ever known. This
surely is the most important deterrent to assassination in despotic
states and it is corroborated by the experience of Italy.</p>

<p>Mussolini’s Fascist state is the least terroristic of the three totalitarian
states. The terror is so mild in comparison with the Soviet or
Nazi varieties, that it almost fails to qualify as terroristic at all. The
best proof I know of this is the experience of an Italian friend of
mine who before Fascism came to Italy was chief correspondent of
one of Italy’s greatest newspapers.</p>

<p>He occupied a position which might be compared with that of
chief Washington correspondent of the <cite>New York Times</cite>. When
Mussolini took power this friend, whom I may call Luigi, was dismissed
from his newspaper because he refused to become a Fascist.
If he had wished to serve Mussolini, he would have been made a
Senator, and would have become a rich man. But no, he was a
courageous, passionately sincere liberal. He used to declare, “I
would approve of nearly all Mussolini’s program (he doubtless
would not say that now), but as long as he wants to compel me to
approve, I disapprove. I shall only approve when I am at liberty to
disapprove.”</p>

<p>Now what would have happened to this sort of man in Soviet
Russia? A leading journalist under the Czar defies Bolshevik power!
You know as well as I what would happen to him. He would be
shot at once. They would not even waste on him food for a day’s
extra meals. He would have been shot the moment the Cheka noticed
him. And what would have happened to Luigi in Germany?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
He would have been sent to a concentration camp and there he
would have been tortured and either gradually killed or turned out
a broken emasculated creature, not a man any more.</p>

<p>But what happened to him in Italy? First, his newspaper, with
which he had a contract, bought off the contract for a sum sufficient
for him to live on in a modest way the rest of his life. At the
same time the police established a twenty-four hour surveillance of
him. Three detectives working in eight-hour shifts were assigned
to watch him. Mind you, he wasn’t arrested, and was even allowed
to become the correspondent of a foreign newspaper.</p>

<p>The detectives were there all the time. Luigi came to know them
well. If they behaved decently and he liked them, he never gave
them any trouble. But if one of them was rude, this is the way
Luigi would do. He would get all his newspapers, a dozen or more
to read in the morning, and though ordinarily he would take a taxi
or walk to his office, now to discipline the detective, Luigi would
get on one of the streetcars which circle Rome and he would sit
there, going around and around the city for a couple of hours,
reading his papers. The detective had to follow him. The detective
rode a bicycle. Two hours of hard road work usually corrected the
manners of the worst of them. Think of that kind of police “Terror,”
and you have a fair idea of the comparative mildness of the
Italian kind of totalitarianism. We used to take delight in counting
up how many hundreds of thousands of lire it had cost the Italian
government to keep three detectives employed for fifteen years.</p>

<p>What has this to do with our theme of assassination? Just this,
that during the first twelve years of Mussolini’s dictatorship he was
attacked twelve times, and several of the attempts only failed by
the narrowest margin.</p>

<p>One of the earliest and most serious attempts was by a former
general who hired a room a couple of hundred yards away from
the Palazzo Chigi, equipped himself with a sporting rifle fitted
with telescopic sights, and waited for Mussolini to come out on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
the balcony to speak. This event may have inspired Geoffrey
Household’s <cite>Rogue Male</cite>. The general was betrayed at the last
moment, arrested, and sentenced to life imprisonment on the Lipari
Islands. That is another index of the comparatively mild
character of the Italian despotism. At that time the Fascist legal
code still had no provision for the death penalty for a plot against
the life of the head of the State.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>In spite of everything you say it still seems difficult to see why
some person half-demented by persecution or the cruelties inflicted
upon his family and friends should not have tried to take
vengeance against the tyrant. There must certainly be among the
victims of Nazi or Bolshevik brutality many persons too tortured
in mind to be able to remember all those considerations you have
advanced?</em></p>

<p>A. Undoubtedly there are, but these persons are generally too
demoralized to act. If they are sufficiently distorted by their suffering
to forget the consequences to their family and friends of an attack
on the tyrant, they are too enfeebled to move. Fear paralyzes
them. The modern totalitarian tyranny, as the German and Russian,
by reason of the ideology of the ruling party and superior
organization of its police force, ferrets out, identifies, and disciplines
a larger percentage of its opponents than any tyranny was
ever able to do in the past. The ideology of the party makes an ex-officio
police agent out of every Communist in Russia and every
Nazi in Germany.</p>

<p>The G.P.U. and Gestapo are superior to the police systems of
former modern tyrannies because this is the first time that tyrannies
have not been ashamed of their political police, but acknowledge,
boast of them, and coerce the population to cooperate with
them. The amorality of Bolshevism and Nazism, or rather their
rejection of the Christian standard of behavior, is best illustrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
by the exceptional position of the political police systems. Under
a regime such as the Czar’s, the political police, the Okhrana, was
likewise an instrument of repression, and as such the regime
showed constant evidence of being ashamed of it.</p>

<p>The efficiency of the Okhrana suffered correspondingly. Today,
in view of our experience with the G.P.U. and the Gestapo, the
Okhrana seems like a benevolent association for the benefit of wayward
Russians. It is instructive now to go back and read the
memoirs of that great opponent of the Czar, the noble revolutionary,
Prince Kropotkin. To note the comparative triviality of the
offenses charged by the revolutionaries against the regime, and
then to note the comparative leniency of the punishments inflicted
by the Czar upon his enemies is to measure the chasm which the
Bolshevik Revolution and the Red Terror dug between our New
Dark Age and the imperfect, liberal, easygoing Past, the like of
which no one in our generation shall ever see again.</p>

<p>Under the Okhrana the number of political assassinations in
Russia culminating with the killing of Alexander the Second,
reached an all-time high. This fact, like the attempts on Mussolini’s
life, corroborate the thesis that mild Terror is ineffective, while
extreme Terror may be completely effective. It seems to me to be
useful to stress this fact about the Nazi or Bolshevik Terror, because
one of our American democratic illusions to which we cling
most fondly is that good will always triumph, liberty will eventually
win over tyranny, and despots will ultimately be overthrown
by their oppressed victims.</p>

<p>This doctrine is not only false, but one of the most harmful of
our wishful thoughts, since it leads us to believe that all may come
right with this very wrong world without our having to do anything
about it. Another instructive pursuit is to get a copy of the
old <cite>Who’s Who of the Russian Communist Party</cite> and observe
that there was not a single leading member of the Party who had
not been at one time or another, and frequently many times, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
arrest by the Okhrana. Stalin, supreme butcher of the lot, was five
times in the hands of the men whom he later was to help exterminate.
One can conservatively say that if the Okhrana had been
operated on the principles of the Soviet Police, not a single leader
of the Bolsheviks would have been left alive, and there would
have been no Bolshevik Revolution as we know it, and no Soviet
Union with its melancholy record of life-taking failure, and perhaps
no Nazi party in Germany, and who knows, perhaps no
World War now.</p>

<p>Absolute Terror not only physically removes the more dangerous
opponents of the tyranny but it reduces the survivors to morbid
obeisance, to a sort of unwilling, servile, unconscious idolatry
of the tyrant. The tyrant, when he attains the stature of Hitler or
Stalin, becomes the Omnipotent Father in the subconsciousness of
all his subjects, including those hostile to him. This makes it all the
more difficult for the rebel to raise his hand in patricide. Those
who insist that the modern tyrants are mere gangsters overlook
the aura of mystic power which is created around the figure of a
ruler daily greeted by choruses of adulation and abasement from
tens of millions of his people. It is no more to be resisted than the
rhythm of tom-toms.</p>

<p>When the Lion of Judah, Emperor Haile Selassie, declared
formal mobilization of his ragged soldiers, he had two batteries of
war drums, one in major, one in minor key, beating their defiant
message all day and all night from his palace in Addis Ababa. The
pulsations of the drums at the Ghibi more than two miles away
came to me in my room in the stables of the Imperial hotel with
a mesmeric force that made me long to follow their rhythmic
directions. The same effect is obtained in the great tyrannies by
the mass salutations of the tyrant worshipers.</p>

<p>Never in history have there been such vast numbers of people
to add the influence of the multitude to the herd instinct to conform.
The greatest tyrannies of long ago, when the human tribe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
was a fraction of its size today, the Roman Empire, the Mongol
Khanates, or even the Indian Mogul Kingdoms, disposed of power
over small populations compared with the more than 250,000,000
now ruled by Hitler or the 200,000,000 by Stalin. In this day of
electric communications the huge bulk of such aggregates does not
become unmanageable. The more territory Hitler conquers, the
more loot he has, the more permanent resources to exploit, and
the more people to enslave at work useful for the Nazis. Our only
hope against him is for his military defeat at the hands of ourselves
and our friends.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You have made discouragingly plain why there are so few political
assassinations in Germany, but couldn’t somebody like the
fellow who killed King Alexander and Barthou in Marseilles be
found?</em></p>

<p>A. I do not think so. That fellow, Vlada Georgiev, was a member
of the famous Imro, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary
Organization, which had the only system I ever heard of to guarantee
that their members carry out assigned assassinations, no matter
what the police terror might be. The Imro’s object was to unify
and obtain the greatest possible degree of independence for Macedonia,
divided among Bulgaria, Greece, and Jugoslavia. Their
chief weapon was assassination, and when the Imro decreed a person’s
death it was about as certain to be carried out as any human
decision can be. The procedure was to appoint a killer and provide
that he be killed unless he fulfilled his task. To make this
principle work it was necessary that the appointed assassin realize
he would more surely die if he failed than if he succeeded and
risked legal execution. A long tradition of killings within the Imro
made this fearful compulsion effective.</p>

<p>The mechanics of the system were simple. Like the Russian
Nihilists under Boris Savinkov, the Imro used to try and formally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
condemn their victims to death. Thereupon the committee would
draw beans from a bag. The man drawing a black bean was the
appointed assassin. He was <em>A</em>. He had to leave the room. The
others drew again. The man drawing the second black bean, <em>B</em>,
was appointed to kill <em>A</em> if <em>A</em> didn’t kill the chosen victim. <em>B</em> then
left the room and a third black bean, <em>C</em>, was appointed to kill <em>B</em>
if <em>B</em> failed to carry out his assignment, and so on until the whole
committee had lined up, each with a gun in the back of another.
No one knew who among his comrades was his potential executioner,
but each knew that death was certain if the decisions of
the committee were not obeyed. Now this sort of system would
work, I believe, even in Nazi Germany, but the democracies are
far too squeamish to indulge in such practical methods.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> A German statistician objected to this description of the Imro system on
the ground that the second to the last man would know that it was the last man
who was delegated to kill him if necessary; and the last man would not have a
gun in his back. True enough mathematically, but the Imro system was run by
practical assassins, not mathematicians. They never let it get to the last man;
the existence of the chain, incomplete though it had to be, guaranteed that the
originally appointed assassin performed his duty.</p>

</div></div>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Did the Nazis or the Bolsheviks practice assassination?</em></p>

<p>A. They both rather looked down on individual killings as dilettante.
They preferred to do away with their victims en masse;
especially the Bolsheviks. I remember at the time of the Blood
Purge of June 30, 1934, when Hitler had murdered one thousand
or more of his opponents, a Polish correspondent in Moscow was
expelled by the Soviet authorities because he commented in a dispatch
from the Russian capital that the Bolsheviks regarded Hitler’s
purge with the same disdain a wholesaler would have toward
the operations of a retailer. One thousand dead would be retail
business for the Bolsheviks. The Communists, however, stood
programmatically on the platform of no “individual terror” as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
they put it, because they considered that assassinations of single
persons were ineffective, time and energy wasting.</p>

<p>The Nazis spurned no weapon, and so they murdered right and
left from the beginning. It was their type of young men, whether
yet organized in the Nazi Party or not, who committed most of
the political assassinations of postwar Germany from Rathenau
and Erzberger until Hitler came to power. Meanwhile, they deliberately
provoked battles with the young men of every other
faction, Democrats as well as Communists, in assemblies and on the
streets, and the deaths from these clashes numbered hundreds
yearly.</p>

<p>After Hitler came to power you might have expected individual
assassinations to cease. But no, the murders by individual Nazis of
individual enemies, business rivals, or of anyone they happened
to dislike, continued through the year 1933 and it was not until
1934 that the Gestapo took over the monopoly of murder. No
claim of Hitler’s is more ridiculous than his boast that the Nazi
revolution was bloodless. There is no record of how many Germans
perished at the hands of the uniformed bullies of the Nazi
Party for strictly personal reasons, but the numbers surely ran into
thousands. I was a correspondent in Berlin during that bloody
year and I can testify as an eyewitness.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But weren’t those stories about atrocities exaggerated? You
know we were fed so much propaganda in the last war that later
turned out untrue, like the Belgian baby’s hands being cut off&mdash;how
much can we believe of the atrocity stories we hear now?</em></p>

<p>A. No, the atrocity stories of today and of yesterday and of the
last war were not exaggerated. The truth is that we shall never
learn of more than the tiniest fraction of the atrocities committed
by the Germans, and I am sure we never learned about more than
a fraction of their atrocities in the last war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>Now by all means let some earnest young man arise and declare
that the British and the French and the Americans also commit
atrocities. Do they? Perhaps, because among our troops as among
the troops of every nation are some exceptionally brutal men, who
when they are possessed of the fury and license of battle become
criminals. But only among the Germans was and is atrocious behavior,
torture, and murder, an official policy, calculatedly carried
out upon the authority of the government to terrorize or exterminate
the vanquished. When I came to Germany I was intensely
sympathetic with the Germans and refused to believe any of the
atrocity stories of the last war. It took many years of residence in
Germany and the experience of living through the bloodiest period
of the Nazi revolution to realize that there was almost no atrocity
charged against the Germans which could not have happened.</p>

<p>What a beautiful example of German propaganda the Belgian
baby atrocity story was. Dr. Goebbels must often have jealously
admired the person, whoever he was, who thought up the Belgian
baby. Do we wish to cast in doubt reports about the atrocities our
people are committing? Very well, let us plant a monstrous charge
against ourselves, which we can prove untrue, then we can claim
(and many of our softheaded opponents will believe us) that all
other charges are untrue. This was the effect of the charge that
German troops had cut off the hands of Belgian babies. Strangely
enough, it was Northcliffe’s <cite>Daily Mail</cite> which obliged the Germans
by first picking up the story of the Belgian baby, and then
offering a reward for proof, and finally printing as a journalistic
scoop the fact that no proof could be found that the Germans had
ever cut off a Belgian baby’s hands. Thus in the minds of millions
of simple British and Americans the Germans were exculpated of
<em>any atrocities</em>. The bombarded British are not likely to make such
a mistake again.</p>

<p>Was there anything in the first World War to equal the deliberate
machine-gunning by German warplanes of the fleeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
populations on the roads of Poland, France, and the Lowlands?
I do not believe it has a counterpart in modern history, and only
Genghis Khan and Tamerlane could have matched it in earlier
days. There were thousands of children including babes in arms
among the dead along the roads scarified by the Luftwaffe. An
American diplomat in Paris estimated that in France and the Lowlands
100,000 civilians, two-thirds of them women and children,
were killed thus by the Germans, or approximately the same as
the number of French soldiers who died in battle. The slaughter
of civilians in Poland surpassed this figure many times.</p>

<p>I do not know why I should boggle at the lopped-off Belgian
baby’s hands, except that nobody could ever find an authentic
example, and I cannot imagine what good it would do the Germans,
nor believe that even Nazi Germans like to torture babies.
The machine-gunning of the roads in Europe had a military object,
to cause panic and to clog the movements of the Allied troops.
But I have seen enough purposeless acts of brutality committed by
the Nazis to know what they are capable of doing.</p>

<p>I wish Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whose sensitivity as a poet I
sincerely admire, could have been with me one day in the women’s
ward of a Berlin hospital as I listened to a woman explain to me
why she lay there bandaged from head to foot, with the blood
still oozing through. It was in the spring of 1933, and the Brown
Terror was getting into its stride, but the Nazis had not yet learned
to bar correspondents from hospitals. After this story they were
all barred.</p>

<p>The woman was Frau Marie Jankowsky, forty-eight years old,
mother of five sons. She was a Social Democratic welfare worker.
“Night before last,” she related to me, pausing only when pain
made her gasp, “a group of Storm Troopers came to our flat. One
of them backed my husband and sons into the kitchen and held
them at the point of his revolver. The others took me away to a
Storm Troop barracks on the second floor of a building not far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
from my house. There they stripped me naked. In the middle of
the room was a table, and covering the table a flag. They asked
me what the flag was.</p>

<p>“I answered it was the Black Red Gold flag of the Republic.
They said ‘No,’ and commanded me to repeat that it was Black
Red Ordure. I refused and four Storm Troopers pulled me face
down over the table, the fifth pushed my face into a bundle of
rags to stop me screaming, and a sixth began beating me across
the back with a light steel rod.</p>

<p>“It cut the skin and made blood come with every blow. The
Storm Troop Captain said, ‘Give her twenty blows, the Jewish
sow.’ I am not Jewish but that did not make any difference. Then
they jerked me off the table and said, ‘You stole shoes from your
welfare section, didn’t you?’ I said, ‘No,’ and the Captain said,
‘Give her another twenty.’ I was bleeding badly when they pulled
me off the table again and yelled at me, ‘What’s this?’ and showed
me our flag of the Iron Front with three arrows. I told them, but
they demanded that I say it was a manure fork. I refused and the
Captain ordered another twenty blows.</p>

<p>“That made sixty, and I was very weak, but finally when they
pulled me off the table again and yelled at me, ‘You served Communists
in your soup kitchen,’ I still had enough strength left to
say, ‘You ought to be ashamed to say that because I served you
and you and you, but no Communists.’ This made them angrier
than ever and the last twenty blows were the worst, and when I
rolled off the table they picked me up, and the Captain struck me
across the face with his riding crop, and then a Storm Trooper
hit me on the jaw with his fist and knocked me across the room
so that I fell and wrenched my knee.”</p>

<p>The livid scar of the riding crop flamed across her face, and
the dressing on her knee confirmed that injury. I asked the medical
attendant to describe her injuries as they were when she arrived
and he confirmed that her back had been cut deep into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
musculature. Yes, I wish Anne Morrow Lindbergh had been with
me to see and hear this story, although it is only one of hundreds
of thousands which could have been related first by German victims
of the Nazis and now by the vanquished of the entire continent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lindbergh says the “Wave of the Future,” by which she
means the wave of collectivism, the wave of Nazism, is irresistible,
and hence we would be wrong to try to resist it, because by resisting
we would only increase the casualty list. She dismisses the
brutalities, atrocities, inhumanities of the conquering Nazis as
merely the “scum” on the wave, something which will pass away
and leave the clear blue water of the New Order. But she has not
viewed this Wave of the Future at firsthand and so she has not
been able to perceive that the scum reaches all the way from the
top to the bottom of the Nazi wave; that there is no clear water
beneath the surface brutality of the New Order, that from its beginning
until today and until it is destroyed it has been, is, and will
be unqualifiedly evil.</p>

<p>Atrocities? I assure you there are more atrocities being committed
this very moment by the hosts of the Gestapo, the Black
Guards, the Storm Troops, and all the other ruffians of Hitler
throughout prostrate Europe than you have ever dreamed about.
If only we could arrange to have all our isolationists, our weasel-worded
noninterventionists, and our complaisant converts to the
Wave of the Future take a trip to Europe and let them observe
the fate of the 150,000,000 under Hitler’s heel. The Wave of the
Future is a wave of blood and tears. What American in his right
mind can wish to live if this wave engulfs our world?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You mentioned Jan Valtin’s book</em>, Out of the Night. <em>Do you
consider the book authentic?</em></p>

<p>A. It is the most accurate description of Nazi and Bolshevik Terror<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
I have ever seen in print. Valtin tells from the inside of the G.P.U.
and the Gestapo what an American newspaperman working in
Russia and Germany could observe in fragments from the outside.
There is not an incident in the book, however gruesome, which
could not have happened, no matter how improbable it may appear
to a reader far away from the horrors of totalitarian police methods.
I recommend the book to every American, because these two evil
weapons of the tyrant states are operating today in our country and
Valtin has given us the most authoritative picture of their activities
we have ever had. Whatever he was in the past, this strange
young German has done more for democracy by writing these grim
memoirs than most democrats who have been democrats all their
lives.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Since Hitler attacked Russia, don’t you think it is no longer
correct to say Nazism and Communism are the same? Hasn’t Hitler
proved now that he is really an enemy of Bolshevism and is protecting
the world against it?</em></p>

<p>A. That would be the equivalent of saying that one monarchy
would not attack another or that you could not have war between
two republics. The war between Hitler and Stalin is a war between
two terroristic collectives. The collectivist form of their economy
is almost identical, both of them being a form of state capitalism;
both are supported by police terror and both found their principle
motive power, the fuel to run their society, in hatred.</p>

<p>Both avowed that the end justifies the means and both thereupon
employed every conceivable form of fraud, deceit, and violence to
attain their ends. Pagan, atheistic rejection of Christianity, deliberate
denial of even the desirability of the principle of universal
brotherly love was common to the two totalitarian creeds. The fact
that the two monsters of malevolence finally turned their hatred
upon one another actively only emphasizes the identical character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
of the fratricidal twins. What of their essential features has changed
since they warred upon each other? Nothing whatever. Does the
Russo-German war prove Hitler’s thesis that he was an implacable
enemy of Bolshevism? Nonsense! Hitler’s brand of Bolshevism is
infinitely more menacing to us all than any produced in Russia. The
bibles of the twin regimes, <cite>Mein Kampf</cite> and <cite>Das Kapital</cite>, preach
identical doctrine: Here, hate everybody of a different race; there,
hate everybody of a different class. Since Jesus Christ was on earth
the Communist Party and the Nazi Party and the states they
founded are the first institutions of such dimensions to be built
avowedly and officially on hatred.</p>

<p>In Russia they began by saying they had to hate and kill in order
to clear the land of all classes hostile to a socialist world, in order
to make room for a happier life. But hatred becomes a habit, grows,
expands monstrously until it cannot find enough victims. Before the
Bolsheviks even gained a far-off glimpse of a happier life their
hatred had become an end in itself. They began, by hating, as they
thought, rationally; they finished by hating and killing themselves.</p>

<p>The proletariat and peasantry, instructed by the Communists,
began by hating the Czar, the aristocrats, bankers, factory managers,
engineers, technicians, schoolteachers, dentists, undertakers,
physicians, lawyers, priests and policemen, everyone who occupied
any position noticeably superior to that of the masses. It took them
about ten years to slaughter this lot, and then they began hating
and killing the better-off farmers. I was there during the final mopping
up of the first victims and again for the extermination of the
second group, and as the last of the identifiable enemies of the
Bolsheviks disappeared in the cellars of the G.P.U., or in the wastes
of Siberia, we in Moscow used to discuss quite seriously what these
furious haters were going to do when they ran out of “classes” to
hate.</p>

<p>It was no joke. It had become indispensable to Bolshevik life to
have an object of hatred and when the object was exterminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
another had to be found. We guessed they would have to begin
hating and killing themselves, and we were right. To us it was not
surprising. When you lived among them, you realized that Communist
“class hatred” is hatred of anyone who gets along better
than oneself and there is just as much hatred of Communists by
Communists as of capitalists.</p>

<p>In no organization has there ever been more back-stabbing,
poisoning, strangling, murderous mutual hatred of one another than
in the Communist Party, from the malignant Russian Central Committee
through all its verminous offspring in the Comintern. They
used to boast of the “monolithic” character of the Russian Communist
Party. It was like a block of granite without a crevice. The
Russian Jacobins declared they would never commit the error of
their French forebears who found they could not stop killing when
once they had started to kill one another. For years the outside
world observed this Bolshevik self-restraint and there was much
fear of it.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the prodigious store of hatred within the Bolshevik
breast burst the bounds of self-preserving sanity and the apostles
of Marx fell to killing each other with bewildering ferocity. Howling
“Wrecker,” “Saboteur,” “Trotzkyist,” “Bukharinist,” “Rightist,”
“Leftist,” “Nazi,” “Fascist,” they shot their own Soviet-reared
professional men, generals, admirals, government officials, in a whirl
of self-destroying madness which left even persistent Soviet sympathizers
unable to explain what was going on because nobody,
possibly including Stalin, understood it. It was like a mad dog biting
himself, tearing out his own viscera. What could be the fate of the
eviscerated animal?</p>

<p>Even before the war, in both Germany and Russia, the omnipotent,
omnivorous State had devoured all but a vestige of happiness.
As the two regimes of hatred went forward along their respective
paths each lost gradually even the desire to promote the happiness
of anybody, even of its own people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>In the land of the Bolsheviks, the bigoted struggle against men of
another class became a struggle against men of another view. The
internal political conflict impaired production, hampered the campaign
against poverty, and protracted the wretchedness of the
population. Nobody ate, drank, slept, lived even decently, much
less comfortably, and there was no security. They had given up
liberty for security. Now security was gone, for to their dismay
the Bolsheviks saw that the one thing for which everything had
been sacrificed, the defense apparatus, was inadequate.</p>

<p>In the land of the Nazis, the attempts of the Supermen to rule the
world led the Germans to forget individual happiness as completely
as the Bolsheviks. The Nazis believed that if they gave up butter
for guns today, they could tomorrow win with their guns more
butter; but the Nazi chief never had any intention of stopping for
butter. In comfort-loving, once-bourgeois Germany, food, clothing,
fuel, transportation deteriorated until it was impossible to find even
a physically happy person outside the young armed forces for
whom the nation sacrificed all. These favored youths found their
chief pleasure in the exercise of a technical skill and lust in combat
which enabled them to crush a continent with playful ease.</p>

<p>Now from the Atlantic to the Pacific, across the greatest continuous
land surface on the globe, from the English Channel to the
Sea of Japan there exists not one comfortable, secure, happy family.
Not among the more than five hundred million persons now in
Europe with its neighbor states could be discovered a trace of the
happiness, imperfect though it was, which used to exist. The Nazi
Bolsheviks had achieved triumph as far as Europe was concerned.
The Wave of the Future had swept happiness from its path.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">2. RUSSIA</h2>
</div>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What is the best way for the United States to help the Russians
fight the German Army?</em></p>

<p>A. The best way for the United States to help the Russians fight
the German Army is for us to go to war against Germany. Our
declaration of war against Germany would be of more value to
Russian resistance than all the war supplies we shall ever be able
to send to the Soviet Union. We ought to try to send the Red
Army as much as we can spare of airplanes and arms and anything
else it needs to help it hold the Germans, but all such aid would
be trivial compared with the effect of our declaration of war.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why? What practical effect on the Russian war effort would
we have by going to war with Germany?</em></p>

<p>A. It would have the moral effect of convincing the Russians that
they would win in the long run; hence it should obviate any
chance, however faint, of Stalin’s capitulating. As we have said
before, it would convince the Germans they would lose the war
and hence would halve their determination to go on. It would
triple our war effort overnight, and result speedily in a vast increase
of production here of the materials the Russians as well as
the British need to carry on the war. It would enable us to base
our Pacific Fleet on Singapore and other British bases in the Far
East, and our Air Force, if it were found expedient, on Russian
bases in Kamchatka and near Vladivostok within bombing distance
of Tokyo. This would not only check the Japanese from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
advancing farther south but from indulging in any military adventure,
such as attacking Siberia, while the danger existed of our
immediate intervention against them. This would relieve pressure
on the Far Eastern Red Army and permit it to send urgently
needed reinforcements to the troops fighting the Germans in
European Russia.</p>

<p>The use of our Atlantic antisubmarine vessels in complete cooperation
with the British Navy in all the war zones would help
break the German counter-blockade and permit a greater quantity
of supplies to reach the British armed forces. It would enable us to
seize those positions we need off the west coast of Africa and on
the coast, and thus provide the first step toward establishing
another take-off place for an expeditionary force against the Reich.
The example of America’s entering the war could lead Weygand,
or other authorities in Morocco, to consider collaboration with us
instead of with the Germans; the north African coast has long
been kept in mind as a possible springboard for invading Europe.
America’s entry into the war would for the first time enable the
British to attempt invasion of the continent. Until now the British
have had to keep at home more reserves than they would need if
they knew the American Army would soon be at their side.</p>

<p>Even with our Army in its present state of semi-preparedness,
we have enough completely trained Regular Army and Marine
units to be able to send abroad for active service an important
contingent which would either take its place immediately in an
invasion force or replace British units assigned to that task. The
first effect upon the Germans of the intelligence that the British
were seriously preparing to attempt an invasion would be to compel
them to send back troops from Russia to threatened points in
Europe.</p>

<p>Finally, from the broadest strategical standpoint, the entry of
the United States would turn the tables on the Germans who until
now have had the advantage of initiative and surprise. Throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the world until now Hitler has kept the world wondering “where
is he going to strike next?” With the United States in the war, it
would be the turn of the Axis powers to wonder where the Anglo-American-Russian
forces were going to strike next, and Hitler
would be forced to keep large numbers of troops stationed at every
point where our forces could possibly attack.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>The Russian resistance to the German attack seems to have
surprised nearly everybody. How do you explain it?</em></p>

<p>A. There are many reasons for it. It is true that almost every expert
expected the Russians to collapse within a few weeks after
Hitler began his drive. Walter Duranty is the only one I know
who said from the outset that the Red Army would hold much
longer than the outside world seemed to expect.</p>

<p>The first reason for Russian resistance is that this was the first
time Hitler ever tackled a country with <em>lives to waste</em> and <em>miles
to waste</em>. Its 200,000,000 population lived almost like animals, but
most of them flourished like healthy animals on their black bread
and cabbage and made sturdy fighting material. They claimed
around 12,000,000 soldiers in their standing army and reserve.
Thus they could lose as many men as the entire German Army
and still have left an army as big as the former French Army. In
fighting against the Germans they could afford to lose two to one
and still have superiority in numbers. Their high command knew
this and wasted lives with abandon but sometimes to advantage.
The same advantage in size held with respect to terrain. They
could afford to retreat over distances equivalent to the width of
many European countries and still have room to live in, just as
the Chinese did.</p>

<p>The second reason for Russian resistance is that this was the
first time Hitler had ever struck an army and a generation untouched
by the humanizing influence of Christianity, immune to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
any form of pacifism, unsoftened by Western civilization. It was
the first time Hitler had ever struck an army that had been taught
that all life is struggle, that to fight for the Soviet Union was the
noblest thing a man or woman could do, the first time the Nazis
had met a fanaticism sharper than theirs. The Bolsheviks invented
totalitarian fanaticism; the Nazis only copied it.</p>

<p>It was the first time the Germans had come up against a people
more savage than themselves. The Bolsheviks were ahead of the
Nazis in pronouncing that the end justifies the means, and the
oriental Russians surpassed the occidental Germans in cruelty. The
Germans have known Hitlerism only since 1933 and until that
time they had normal contacts with the outside world. The Russians
have known nothing but Bolshevism since 1918 and from
that moment on have been hermetically sealed from the outside
world.</p>

<p>For war-making this savage insularity has its uses. The Red
Army is even more fanatically homogeneous in its political faiths
and hatreds than is the Nazi Army. Everybody under the age of
forty in Russia today has experienced either throughout life or in
adult life nothing but the Soviet regime. The Russians have the
advantage that they have been practicing totalitarians all their
lives and are used to it. For the civilian population not immediately
in the path of the battles there was less change in the move from
peace to war in the Soviet Union than in any other belligerent
state, because the Russians have been living on a war footing since
1918.</p>

<p>During this generation of hardships their Asiatic characteristics
have been deepened, their fatalistic contempt for death increased.
They are content to let the Party guide their emotions. There are
no Hamlets among them. The Russians Dostoevsky wrote about,
who dreamed and sorrowed and could not act&mdash;all these have
long been eliminated. Also no living inhabitant of the Soviet Union
has been corrupted by ease or luxury! Yet because they are completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
cut off from the outside world the Russians think the Soviet
Union superior to any other country. This is an advantage in war.</p>

<p>Isolated and youthful, the Russians after twenty-three years
of suffering and historically unparalleled loss of life through revolution,
famine, and terror, still were not disillusioned by a political,
social, and economic system which had given them a standard of
living and culture beneath that of any large white community in
the world. There were no ideological divisions to rend the nation,
since all who differed with the ruling clique were liquidated the
moment the difference became apparent. Hence there was no
Fifth Column in Russia. Since Soviet justice or Stalin policy goes
on the principle that it is better to execute a hundred innocents
than to let one guilty escape, the purge of 1934-1938 probably did
eliminate important Fifth Columnists, together with many valuable
military and industrial leaders.</p>

<p>A third reason for the strength of the Russian resistance is that
the Red Army for the past twenty-three years has received a
larger share of the national income in peacetime than any other
defense force of any nation has ever enjoyed, including Germany.
Though Russia starved, the Red Army ate well. On the four
occasions&mdash;1925-1927, 1930, 1934, and 1937&mdash;when I visited the
Soviet Union and worked there as a correspondent, I noticed that
no matter how poorly the rest of the population was dressed, Red
Army soldiers always wore good uniforms and strong leather
boots. This was because ever since the Soviet Union was born,
every leader from Lenin and Trotzky to Stalin was profoundly
convinced that “the capitalist world will never permit the Socialist
State to exist and some day will seek to destroy us.”</p>

<p>Of course this attack of Hitler’s is not the attack of the capitalist
world upon the Socialist State, and the Socialist State now finds the
capitalist world its only ally. Nevertheless the unshakable and
correct Bolshevik belief in inevitable war led the regime to impose
the greatest sacrifices upon the people for the sake of the armed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
forces, and even though the Soviet economy was most backward,
the enormous amounts expended were bound to have effect.</p>

<p>Even in American terms the Soviet defense budget was large.
In 1940 it was the equivalent of $11,000,000,000, and represented
one-third of the national expenditure. Measure this against the
fact that the infinitely richer United States will approximate the
expenditure of that much yearly only in 1942 after two years of
our greatest defense effort.</p>

<p>Most of the money spent on the Red Army and Air Force went
for machines of war. Twenty-three years ago when the Bolshevik
revolution took place there were few machines in Russia. Marx
said Communism must come in a highly industrialized society.
The Bolsheviks identified their dreams of socialist happiness with
machines which would multiply production and reduce hours of
labor until everyone would have everything he needed and would
work only as much as he wished. Somehow this has not come
about, but the Russians still worship machines, and this helped make
the Red Army the most highly mechanized in the world, except
perhaps the German Army now.</p>

<p>Like Americans, the Russians admire size, bigness, large numbers.
They took pride in building a vast army of tanks, some of them
the largest in the world, armored cars, airplanes, motorized guns,
and every variety of mechanical weapon. Their quality was seldom
the best. Few things produced in the Soviet Union have attained
high quality, but the attempt is made to compensate by quantity.</p>

<p>Bolshevik love of novelty, eagerness to experiment and try new
things (they invented parachute troops), their willingness to discard
traditional methods, and their liking for youthful leadership
all were advantages. The Red Army apparently was the only one
to learn from the lessons of the German campaign in Poland&mdash;which
were open for the instruction of the French, British, Dutch,
Belgians, and every other country in Europe, but were ignored
by all of them. Stalin’s purge of the Red Army wherein he executed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
or otherwise eliminated one-fourth of the senior officers
was believed at the time to have done unmitigated harm, but besides
the probability that it disposed of some real Fifth Columnists, it
destroyed nearly all the older generals, and left the field for men
under fifty. Voroshiloff and Budenny were vestigial exceptions.
In this day of brand-new warfare youth has an advantage.</p>

<p>We have to include here also the fact that the Russian is an
excellent pilot. He has reckless courage, keen eyesight, abounding
health, contempt for the enemy, and fanatical belief in his cause.
The Russians have a word they like to apply to themselves,
<i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Shirokaya Natura</i>, meaning broad-natured, lavish-tempered. That
is a characteristic of all the good pilots I have ever known. It
means they are ready to spend themselves, their lives, as readily
as they spend their money. The R.A.F. has it, Udet has it, Goering
has it, the American and Canadian pilots have it, and the Russians
have it. I dare say Lindbergh must have had it once. There are
millions of boys in Russia of pilot age.</p>

<p>The fourth set of reasons for Russian resistance is based upon
the immense benefit the Red Army won through the occupation
of the Finnish Mannerheim line, the Baltic states, Eastern Poland,
and Bessarabia during the time Hitler was busy conquering the
rest of Europe. This action of Stalin’s was typical of the principle
that the end justifies the means. If you believed in this principle
and in the righteousness of the Soviet cause, you would now have
to admit that the end did justify the means in this case, since the
creation of this screen of territory enabled the Red Army to defeat
the Blitz.</p>

<p>The term Blitzkrieg, frequently misused, technically means the
destruction of your enemy by action so swift that he is not able to
mobilize, or bring up his forces to meet yours at the decisive point.
The screen of occupied territory slowed up the Germans long
enough for the Red Army to mobilize fully. Thereafter the great
distances, the bad roads, the unfavorable weather, and the scorched-earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
policy impeded the German advance, while Russian guerilla
warfare proved more effective than anything of the kind the Germans
had ever met.</p>

<p>Russian guerilla fighting is not the old-fashioned kind, where
a farmer hides with a shotgun to catch an enemy sentry with his
back turned. During the Russian Civil War, the most ferocious
conflict of modern times until its Spanish equivalent, the Reds
especially developed Partisan warfare. This consisted in deliberately
hiding companies of several score or hundred heavily armed men
until the enemy passed forward. These guerillas would then attack
from the rear, usually by night, and often annihilate whole detachments
of the enemy. Their ambushes, ruses, and surprises were
endlessly ingenious. The guerillas seldom wore uniforms. They
were invariably shot if captured. They also never took prisoners
except to obtain information by torture. They were extremely
successful. Heretofore the Germans have been able to terrorize
their conquered populations by the exercise of utterly ruthless
Terror. They will have less success with the Russians than with
any people they have yet tried to break, except perhaps the Serbs.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But that is a very long list of reasons for Russian resistance.
Can’t you sum them up for us in a word?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, the answer is morale, or better, faith. That word with
its deep Christian connotations may sound blasphemous when applied
to the atheist Bolsheviks, but it is a true faith, in reverse,
founded upon hatred. It may be objected that faith is a positive
force and it may be asked in what do the Russians have faith? In
their dogma, their doctrine, their nation, or faith in themselves, or
the faith that lies in their deep attachment to their soil? Or is it not
their faith in the unspeakably evil character of their enemies? I
think it is the last. The Bolsheviks have taught all Russians to hate
the Fascists, as they generically call the Nazis, with a ferocity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
which surpasses anything in our experience. This sort of faithful
hatred is a terrific force. It inspires to limitless valor. It is a priceless
asset in war. The Russians see the Nazi legions as the incarnation
of wickedness, led by the devil himself. They are right. Furthermore
they are inspired to fight by the belief, also correct, that if
they lose they will suffer intolerable punishment. Unlike the
French they have no illusions about the fate that awaits them at
the hands of the man who has called them the “scum of the earth.”</p>

<p>This hatred of their enemies and fear of the consequences of
defeat are probably the strongest feelings animating the Russians
in battle, but they have also an incredible faith in themselves. It
makes no difference that this faith is founded for the most part on
lack of knowledge of the outside world, and the absence of any
chance to compare themselves with other nations and other systems:
they are unshakably convinced that they are what would
have been called in another time and another place, “God’s
anointed.” An American general defined morale as “when a soldier
thinks his army is the best in the world, his regiment the best in
the army, his company the best in the regiment, his squad the best
in the company, and that he himself is the best blankety-blank
soldier man in the outfit.” This is what the Red Army soldier
thinks. The Red Army was not impressed by the German victory
in France. After all, the defeated were “just Frenchmen, just
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>.”</p>

<p>The average Russian has a strong conviction, unspecified and
unsupported by evidence, but forming a subconscious background
for all his thinking about the war, that the citizens of the outside
world, in “capitalist-imperialist” and “capitalist-fascist” states alike,
are composed of two classes, depraved slave drivers and spiritless
slaves. He even looks down on the proletariat abroad which has
gone these twenty years without making the revolution the Russians
made. It was a bitter revelation to many an American and
other foreign Communist leader on visiting Moscow the first time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
to be assigned a cubbyhole in the old Lux Hotel, and to be forced
to wait hours for an audience with a Russian official who scarcely
troubled to conceal his contempt for the inferior foreign communist.</p>

<p>We are surprised that the Russians, after all these years of starving
and pain and suffering, should still possess the morale to fight,
but we overlooked the fact that faith thrives on tribulation. The
British had no faith and no morale until they were threatened with
death and punished with fire. Today they have a faith in their
cause such as they have not had since they became a nation, and
now they announce they will scorch the earth, and if necessary
burn London before the advance of an invader. Today the British
are poor in food and clothes and lodgings, but rich in spirit. The
Russians are likewise, and though it is painful to say it, so are the
Germans. We alone among the nations are still rich in material
goods and poor in spirit, for we lack faith. Where are those among
us furious to fight for liberty and democracy?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do you mean to say the Russians have more faith in their
cause than we do in ours?</em></p>

<p>A. I do.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How can you say such a thing, how do you mean it?</em></p>

<p>A. I think you are surprised because you confuse faith and morality.
They have nothing to do with each other.</p>

<p>The morality of the Nazis and the Bolsheviks is abhorrent. That
has nothing to do with the fact that their faith was strong enough
to make them great warriors. The best fighters in the Spanish
Civil War, Ernest Hemingway testifies, were the Moors. Those
skinny brown men, who looked so insignificant and whose behavior
was so abominable, were always chosen, if available, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the shock troops, as when they relieved the Alcazar. They fought
with the bravery traditional of the Mohammedan warrior from
the Ottoman Turks to the Afghans. Their morals were criminal.
They butchered, looted, raped with neither compunction nor discrimination.</p>

<p>I have seen them walking down a village street laden with sewing
machines, women’s clothing, surgical instruments, and chicken
feed to set up shop in a Cathedral underneath the image of the
Saviour whose head they had hacked off. Decent folk on Franco’s
side were appalled, but Franco could not do without them. They
had a faith that only the Catholic Requetés on the one hand and
the Communists on the other could equal, and when they went
into battle the Moors sang. I have heard them and reflected that
good and evil have nothing to do with faith which moves mountains
and wins wars. Are we today in the United States going into
battle singing? We are not even going into battle, although we
admit it is ours.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do you mean to say the Moors fought for the Mohammedan
faith in Spain?</em></p>

<p>A. I do not. I mean to say that they fought because they believe
the profession of a man is to fight, and in fighting they are upheld
in spirit by their belief in Allah, and their faith in his promises.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What do the Russians fight for? They have no Allah and believe
in no hereafter.</em></p>

<p>A. I am not sure that either of those statements is correct. The
images of Lenin, Stalin, and Marx blend in the primitive Soviet
Russian mind together with dim memories of Orthodox ritual to
make up a kind of ikon of Communism. In some minds it may be
only the figure of Father Lenin, now mummified, deified, or at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
least sanctified, in his glass coffin on the Red Square, but in all
save the minds of the intellectualized leaders there is some personification
of the faith. As for belief in a hereafter, I have sometimes
wondered if even the highest leaders of the Party are always
as sure as their Bezbozhnik Society, the Society of the Godless,
professes to be.</p>

<p>The Bezbozhniks’ battle against God would be meaningless unless
they thought, however subconsciously, that there must be
something there to fight. Twice I have seen Stalin stand at the
graveside of a lifetime comrade, once at the burial of Frunze and
once at Kirov’s, and each time as the final words were spoken and
the earth fell and the bells of the Kremlin tolled, I scrutinized his
face for a sign of his thoughts and under the spell of the moment
I always thought I could see the flicker of a question across his
gloomy face. As a matter of fact I suppose he was absorbed in
thinking how to finish the ceremony as quickly as possible in
order to get back to his office and ensure that a good Stalin man
succeeded the dead.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is it true that in order to curry favor with the outside world
the Soviet government has restored freedom of worship?</em></p>

<p>A. Freedom of worship in the Soviet Union was never frankly
and publicly prohibited; it was merely quietly strangled. Today
its public restoration is a gesture toward the outside world and
an effort to canalize even the religious energies sleeping in the
hearts of the older people, into national defense. All the old
shibboleths of religion and patriotism and nationalism and local
pride and mystic faith in Holy Russia which for two decades had
been banned have now been revived. In the supreme trial of war
the Russian people have returned instinctively to the deep primitive
traditions common to man everywhere. Their Bolshevik masters
have apparently recognized the desirability of kindling fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
energy from any fuel, and have permitted a veritable carnival of
emotions which a short while ago would have been condemned as
“bourgeois” and “counterrevolutionary.” Who knows what further
changes the war may bring?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>American friends of the Soviet Union claim that her present
resistance to the Germans entitles her now to our moral approval,
and that we are obligated to give it to our “Ally.” Is this true?</em></p>

<p>A. I am sure Stalin does not care for our moral approval. He
would much rather have our material support. Those Americans
who changed their views of the Soviet Union either when Stalin
signed his pact with Hitler in August 1939, or when the Red
Army attacked Finland, or when it marched into Poland, the
Baltic states, and Bessarabia, or again when the Germans attacked
Russia and the Red Army fought back&mdash;such observers only proved
that their judgment of Stalin’s system was founded on mere day-to-day,
surface events. When they approved of the Soviet Union
it was for wrong reasons; when they disapproved it was for wrong
reasons.</p>

<p>None of the events just named meant any change in the nature
of the Soviet regime. If one approved of it today for resisting
Germany, one ought to have approved of it in August 1939 for
having signed up with Germany. Both acts had the same motive:
the self-interest of the Stalin regime.</p>

<p>Whether we wish to extend our moral approval to the Stalin
regime or not, we all owe profound gratitude and respect to the
Russian people. It is said that every people gets the kind of government
it deserves, but I do not think this has ever been true of the
Russian people; they have never had as good a government as
they deserved. Today they are demonstrating a spirit on the battlefield
which places us forever in debt to them. Whatever his regime,
the Russian soldier is giving his life to defeat the Germans and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
every sacrifice of a Russian life means the possible saving of an
American life.</p>

<p>To the Russian people we owe our friendship as well as all our
support. Our support can reach the Russian people only through
their regime. Let us keep the distinction sharp and the supplies
moving.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Aren’t we running a risk if we support the Russians?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, we are compelled to run a risk no matter what we do.
The time when we could have made ourselves secure without risk
is long past; our isolationists saw to that. Today we risk much if
we support the Soviet Union, but we risk more if we do not. If
we do not support her, we risk Hitler’s winning the resources of
Russia. If we do support her, we risk two things, first, that after we
have poured supplies and munitions, airplanes, gasoline, and guns
into Russia, Stalin might capitulate and these war materials would
fall into the hands of the Germans.</p>

<p>The other risk is that with our help the Red Army should not
only hold the Germans but actually defeat them and invade and
occupy Germany. I purposely draw this picture crudely. This is
a small immediate risk, for the Red Army has not the offensive
power to do it. But suppose the Red Army were able to hold the
Germans for another year, the while Britain with the United
States’ help grows strong enough in the air to obtain supremacy
over the Luftwaffe on the Western Front. Suppose during this
time, with the aid of shipments from the United States the Red
Air Force recovers and also grows strong enough to dominate the
Luftwaffe on the Eastern Front. It is then possible to imagine a
time when the Germans, disintegrating from within, would begin
to withdraw from the East and the Red Army begin to attack.</p>

<p>When once Germany begins to crumble, it is the conviction of
all who know that brittle country that she will fall apart at once.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
It will be a miracle, indeed, if she finds a Hindenburg to lead her
armies home and demobilize them in orderly fashion. It will be
more of a miracle if a Prince Max of Baden can be found in Germany
to apply for an armistice or negotiated peace.</p>

<p>The German Army will have been defeated, disrupted, demoralized.
For a time there will be anarchy. Then all will depend
upon which forces reach German territory and the German capital
first, the Red Army or the armies of the West. If we have stayed
out of the war, or have participated only as a naval and air power;
if the Western Allies have conquered Germany on the sea and in
the air, but have left the land to be conquered by the Red Army;
then if the Red Army pushes into Germany before our forces can
arrive, it will mean Communist revolution throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Why has the world not gone Communist long ago? It is because
Communism, or its Soviet version, in the only country it was ever
tried, had been a peacetime failure. Let us not argue the definition
of Communism and whether we ought to call it State Capitalism.
The world had made up its mind that the collectivist system as
practiced by the Russians could not produce enough to make its
population as well off as the people were even under old-fashioned,
broken-down, rickety capitalism. Now, victory by the Red Army
would be evidence that Russian Communism could do what Western
capitalism could not do&mdash;defeat Hitler. The populations of
Europe would count that power victorious whose land armies were
on the spot to occupy the territory of the defeated. If the Red
Army were to get there first, it would prove to millions of uncritical
observers that the Soviet system had won, that it was a
success to be emulated, and in the circumstances of disorder and
unemployment which would prevail at the conclusion of the war,
such a judgment could lead to continental upheaval.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How can we prevent this and at the same time see that Nazi
Germany is defeated?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<p>A. Only by going to war against Germany now. Never since the
war began have we had any stronger reasons for entering the war
than now. We cannot afford to stay out and allow Hitler the possibility
of winning the war by getting Russia. We cannot afford
to stay out and allow the Bolshevik regime the possibility of winning
the continent of Europe to Communism.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But can Stalin be trusted?</em></p>

<p>A. Certainly not. His agreement with Churchill not to conclude a
separate peace is worth even less than the solemn promise the
French government made on March 28, 1940 to make no separate
peace, just three months before it made a separate peace over the
protest of its Ally, Britain.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why do you say Stalin’s promise is worth even less than that?</em></p>

<p>A. Because Bolsheviks, from whom the Nazis have copied their
ethics, do not believe in keeping their word. I do not mean this
frivolously or cynically. On page 323 of volume XVII of the collected
works of Lenin, the father of Bolshevism wrote: “Morality
is that which serves the destruction of the old exploiter’s society
... which creates a new society of communists. Communist morality
is that which serves this struggle.... We do not believe in
eternal morality and we expose the deceit of all legends about
morality.” As the end justifies the means and the end is the State,
so treaty breaking is justified when it serves the State. For a Bolshevik
or a Nazi, one of the most absurd phrases in the Bible is the
reference to the obviously bourgeois simpleton who sweareth to
his own hurt and changeth not. For both Bolshevik and Nazi the
theory is that individual honor must always be sacrificed if necessary
to the State, and the State itself has no obligation of honor to
any other State, or individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>

<p>You may say that the only difference between a Bolshevik’s or
Nazi’s breaking his word and a bourgeois’ doing the same is that
the Bolshevik or Nazi would be proud of it and the bourgeois
would not. True enough, and that makes all the difference between
a moral world and an amoral world. It is the difference between
the recognition of morality and the defiance of it&mdash;the difference
between civilization and the jungle. This jungle attitude we hope
to eliminate by defeating Hitler.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How do you expect to eliminate this jungle by fighting on the
side of the Bolsheviks?</em></p>

<p>A. We would not be “fighting on the side of the Bolsheviks.” We
would be fighting disease with disease. As a youth I studied medicine
for a while in Vienna, and one of my professors was the great
Wagner-Jauregg, the discoverer of the malaria treatment for the
tertiary stage of syphilis. Wagner-Jauregg observed that some of
his paretic patients who contracted another disease accompanied
by high fever would after the recession of the fever often be almost
cured of their syphilitic disabilities. He began to inoculate his
syphilitic patients with malaria and thus by using one disease against
another won a considerable number of victories over the more
dangerous of the two afflictions. After curing the syphilis it was
relatively easy to cure the malaria. Nazi Germany is at this moment
as much more dangerous than Bolshevik Russia to our world
as syphilis is more malignant than malaria.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>So you think Bolshevism, after it has helped eliminate Nazism,
will be as easy to cure as malaria?</em></p>

<p>A. Probably not, but we may entertain reasonable hopes that in
case the Red Army as distinct from the Bolshevik Party is victorious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
or even semi-victorious over the invading Germans, it
will have more to say in the affairs of Russia than ever in the past.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do you consider that would be an improvement?</em></p>

<p>A. Decidedly. Armies are usually conservative and pacifist. If we
want to get rid of the Communist International and have Russia
re-enter the family of nations, let the Red Army take hold of affairs
in the Kremlin. Stalin is afraid of it.</p>

<p>In the purge of 1934-1938 Stalin arrested no less than 30,000
officers according to an estimate quoted by Louis Fischer. He
started by executing the head of the army, Tukhachevsky, and
seven other of the highest generals, then three more, and so on until
there were left of the original staff only Voroshiloff and Budenny.
Some may have been guilty of wishing to cooperate with the Nazis,
but most were killed because Stalin feared they were plotting
against him.</p>

<p>Stalin’s principal instrument of espionage against his own army
is the system of political commissars, whereby a Stalin party man
is allocated to each Red commander, with the prime duty of watching
his every move, listening to his every word, and if possible
trapping him into an indiscretion. This obviously hinders military
efficiency, and in times when Stalin feels safe or when he wants
military efficiency more than an immediate sense of personal
security, he gives it up.</p>

<p>When he attacked Finland, for example, he felt strong enough
personally to give it up, and the Red Army improved sufficiently
to win. There was much boasting among Communists that the Red
Army now no longer would need political commissars again, but
to their disappointment, shortly after the German attack on Russia,
Stalin reinstalled his commissars. This at the moment when the
Soviet Union was more gravely threatened than ever in its history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
meant that Stalin felt himself less menaced by the defeat of the Red
Army than by the Red Army itself.</p>

<p>Is it farfetched to imagine that since Stalin has played the part
of a super-Robespierre, the time may come when he will suffer
Robespierre’s end?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>If you say, as you did, that Stalin would make a separate peace
if it suited him, despite his agreement not to do so, what was the
use of Britain’s offering and entering into such an agreement?</em></p>

<p>A. It was useful to make the agreement in order to convince Stalin
that Britain, for her part, intends to keep on fighting no matter
what happens. This might encourage Stalin to fight a little longer
than he might have done if he thought that at any moment he might
be deserted by his Ally. You remember the <cite>New Yorker</cite> anecdote
about the suburbanite who met the town Communist soon after
Germany attacked Russia, and twitted him about the German-Soviet
pact, but without results.</p>

<p>The Communist said blandly that it was only to be expected, that
it proved Russia was the dominant figure on the international scene,
and so on. Then he added: “The only time I was worried was when
I was listening to Churchill’s speech on the radio. For a minute, at
the beginning, I thought he was going to rat on us.” So the Anglo-Soviet
agreement is strictly one-way, but it has its uses. It may persuade
Stalin that Churchill is not going to rat on him!</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Under what circumstances do you think Stalin would make a
separate peace?</em></p>

<p>A. At any time Hitler would let him have peace and remain in
power and retain sufficient of the framework of the Soviet system
to promise its continuance after the Western powers had defeated
Hitler. It is plain now that, once the Germans had attacked, Stalin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
must have realized he had to fight or die, for Hitler was evidently
sure of quick, complete victory. If Stalin had tried to capitulate,
as some thought he would, without fighting, he could have obtained
nothing better than obliteration of himself and his regime. Therefore
Stalin fought, but this does not necessarily mean he intends to
fight to the bitter end, with the Red Army backing up to the Urals,
to Siberia, and the Soviet government moving to Sverdlovsk or
Novosibirsk, as romantic enthusiasts would have it.</p>

<p>Stalin probably defines his task to fight Hitler so well, make it
cost the Germans so much, that Hitler will finally offer a peace
Stalin could afford to accept on the basis of his expectation that
Germany would in the long run lose the war. The Bolshevik surrender
at Brest-Litovsk in 1918 was based on similar reasoning, that
the Bolsheviks’ enemy, Germany, would eventually be removed by
world revolution and that good Bolshevik strategy would seek first
to preserve the structure, if only a skeleton structure, of the Soviet
Socialist State, at any cost of immediate humiliation and suffering.</p>

<p>The Russians have proved now by their destruction of the great
dam at Dniepropetrovsk that they mean truly to scorch the earth
before Hitler even if it means the destruction of their most precious
possessions. The destruction of the Dnieper dam was to my mind
the most important single event of the Russian-German war.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why was the blowing up of the Dnieper dam so important?</em></p>

<p>A. Because Dnieprostroy was an object almost of worship to the
Soviet people. Its destruction demonstrates a will to resist which
surpasses anything we had imagined. I know what that dam meant
to the Bolsheviks. I visited it in 1930 when it was being built under
the supervision of the American engineer, Hugh Cooper. It was
the largest, most spectacular, and most popular of all the immense
projects of the First Five-Year Plan. It was the principal source of
hydroelectric power for the Ukraine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p>During all the years under the Soviet government the Russian
people had to do without romance, until the Five-Year Plan was
begun. Then they began to find glamour in statistics. They glorified
in figures showing that this or that project in the Soviet Union was
the largest of its kind in the world. The Dnieper dam when it was
built was the biggest on earth and so it occupied a place in the
imagination and affection of the Soviet people difficult for us to
realize. I remember standing in the middle of the mile-long dam
and listening to a young Soviet engineer rhapsodically exclaim:
“You see there, that forest of cranes, that army of excavating machines!
There is more machinery concentrated on this construction
site than was ever concentrated anywhere in the world! Look at
those gravel mixers. We are pouring here five thousand cubic meters
of gravel, more per day than any body of men ever poured in the
history of the world! See those immense snail-shaped turbo dynamos!
They are the biggest ever made. We will supply more electricity
from a single point than ever....” And so he went on
endlessly, and back in Moscow people would eagerly scan the
newspapers for the latest bulletins on Dnieprostroy.</p>

<p>Stalin’s order to destroy it meant more to the Russians emotionally
than it would mean to us for Roosevelt to order the destruction
of the Panama Canal. Suppose our troops defending the canal were
to have been driven back by the invading Japanese until it became
evident they would capture the canal if we did not destroy it. If
our troops then blew up the locks, it would be an act of determination
which could be compared to that of the Russians in blowing
up the Dnieper dam.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Well then, doesn’t this prove that the Russians will fight to the
bitter end and never make a separate peace?</em></p>

<p>A. Perhaps, but not necessarily. They may fight to the bitter end
but even the Dnieper dam does not prove it. The task of Stalin, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
appears now, is by just such a demonstration of stubborn courage,
to whittle down Hitler’s demands until they reach Stalin’s ability to
accede to them. If he can get Hitler to offer to keep the Soviet government
and bureaucracy in power and to withdraw the bulk of
the German troops, and not to demand too much in the way of
demobilization of the Red Army, the two tyrants might once more
get together.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But why should Stalin quit? Why should he ever be willing to
make such a compromise peace if in the long run he believes Germany
will be beaten?</em></p>

<p>A. Because the Soviet Union is not strong enough economically to
go on fighting indefinitely, particularly if the industries and mines
and agriculture of Southern Russia are cut off by the Germans. It
would be a miracle if the Russians could endure a long war. Most
peoples have a surplus they can do without in wartime. The Soviet
Union has no surplus.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What about the Chinese? They didn’t seem to have a surplus
either, but they have gone on fighting the Japanese now for over
four years.</em></p>

<p>A. That is true and important, but the Chinese economy was decentralized.
The Chinese lives locally. Chinese communities could
be cut off from the outside world and live almost normally. The
Soviet economy is centralized, a closely knit system of collective
farms-mines-factories, which if ruptured at one point would tend
to go to pieces. Nevertheless there is a significant similarity between
the primitive character of the Russian and the Chinese peasants,
and their ability to improvise a living and keep on fighting when
more highly civilized folk, as the French, would give in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Under what circumstances do you think Hitler would offer
Stalin a compromise peace?</em></p>

<p>A. The moment he believes he has defeated the Red Army sufficiently
to force Stalin to accept a peace which would include
substantial demobilization of the Red Army&mdash;enough to ensure that
it could not be used for a sudden attack on the German Army after
it had returned its attention to the West. It is probable that Hitler
had much more totalitarian goals in view when he first attacked
Russia; but the Red Army has probably made him content for the
moment with less.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Isn’t there some evidence that Hitler is after an all-out victory
over Russia and intends no compromise, but complete conquest?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, the most direct evidence we have of such an intention is
contained in his speech of September 12, 1936 at Nuremberg, when
he said: “If the Ural mountains with their immeasurable wealth of
raw materials, Siberia with its rich forests, and the Ukraine with
its immense grain fields, were lying within Germany, this country
under National Socialist leadership would be swimming in wealth.
We would produce so much that every single German would have
more than enough to live on.”</p>

<p>This does not sound as though he intended to stop short of anything,
but the fact still remains that unless he believes he can make
peace with the West (and he cannot have much hope for that after
the Roosevelt-Churchill proclamations of peace terms), his most
advantageous solution of the war would be compromise, with Stalin
or some other Russian leader as his Gauleiter.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Wouldn’t Hitler obtain more supplies if he took them than if
he trusted to the Soviets to deliver them, even if they promised to
do so after having been conquered?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<p>A. Not for a very long time, probably several years. If Hitler,
completely defeating the Red Army, were to try to replace the
Soviet system with something of his own devising, imagine the
chaos! There are several million employees of the Soviet bureaucracy.
Suppose they all sabotaged as the Czarist bureaucracy
sabotaged the Bolsheviks when they seized power. It took the Bolsheviks
five years to work back up from starvation in 1918 to the
level of subsistence in 1923.</p>

<p>Suppose the scorched-earth policy is extended to the oil fields
of the Caucasus. Really determined skilled effort can make an oil
field unproductive for a year or more. To pursue the Red forces
into the Urals and beyond and then to hold down the whole country
would be a task which would absorb the energies of even the
German war machine. There would thus be bargaining points on
both sides.</p>

<p>Hitler could say to Stalin: “I can utterly destroy you and your
system if I choose.” Stalin could say to Hitler: “Yes, but I can
make your conquest futile as far as supplies are concerned, and if
you try to destroy me and my system I will starve you and tire
you until you are too weak to win in the West.” Stalin’s argument
might well run that by making a compromise peace he could save
something, including his own job, from the wreck; then by waiting
patiently for the victory of the Allies which he probably foresees in
the long run, he would win back everything, just as the Bolsheviks
did after they had deserted the Allies in the first World War.</p>

<p>Hitler, on the other hand, knows that without Stalin’s help he
cannot begin to obtain the materials he needs from Russia in time
to serve his necessity. Douglas Miller points out that in the two
summers of 1917 and 1918 when the Germans occupied the Ukraine,
they got only 43,000 small carloads of grain, which scarcely paid
the costs of occupation. Only with Stalin as his Gauleiter can Hitler
make his Russian investment pay economically during the critical
next two years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What would be the effect of such a compromise peace between
Germany and Russia on the United States and Great Britain?</em></p>

<p>A. It would be a disaster even worse than the signing of the original
Soviet-German pact in August 1939.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why worse? It would be just about the same, wouldn’t it?</em></p>

<p>A. No, because this time Hitler would have obtained what he
thought he had obtained but had not obtained from Russia through
his 1939 pact. He would have nearly complete security on the Eastern
frontier and would not have to pin down there more than a
fraction of the divisions he had there from 1939 on.</p>

<p>He would have obtained guaranteed deliveries of the oil and
grain and other products he needs. His guarantee would be the
disarmament of the Red Army to the point where the Germans
could march in at any moment and enforce their demands. He
would also have obtained the right to march his troops across the
Ukraine, or sail across the Black Sea and from the Caucasus drive
at Suez, or eventually India. Furthermore the re-neutralization, or
the military emasculation, of the Soviet Union would free Japan’s
rear from the danger of attack, and would proportionately increase
the chances of Japan’s attacking southward in the area of
our vital interests. Such a compromise peace would enable Hitler
to endure many years longer than if he had to fight on to the complete
conquest of Russia, against a nationwide, scorched-earth,
guerilla warfare.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You make it seem as though a compromise peace were quite
possible. Why then did Stalin fight at all?</em></p>

<p>A. You mean, when the Germans attacked? Because he was given
no choice. There was rumor of Hitler’s having submitted an ultimatum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
or terms to Stalin, but as it turned out Hitler submitted no
demands at all; he simply attacked.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why didn’t Hitler at least make the attempt and demand of
Stalin the things he wanted, including the demobilization of the
Red Army?</em></p>

<p>A. I suppose he knew that even Stalin could not successfully order
the demobilization of the Red Army without suffering the danger
of revolution. Hitler had successfully brought the armies of several
powers under his control without fighting: Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, but they were small states which
would never have stood a chance for more than a few hours or days
of resistance against the Germans. It seemed to many people that
Hitler could have done the same with Russia. The acquiescence of
Stalin in every other German demand encouraged this belief. But
Hitler never made the trial.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>I still do not see why he did not try.</em></p>

<p>A. Perhaps because of Napoleon. This is only a theory of mine,
but in analyzing Hitler’s motives for attacking Russia, it struck me
that his vanity may have led him to wish to impose his will by force
upon Stalin, his only remaining rival on the continent, and to do
the thing Napoleon failed to do, conquer Russia. Hitler is an
admirer of Napoleon. When he first visited Paris he spent half an
hour alone by the tomb of Napoleon, then ordered the remains of
Napoleon’s son brought from Vienna to be re-interred beside his
father. Hitler does not collect ordinary Napoleonana as Mussolini
does. Hitler collects the same countries which Napoleon once collected
or tried to collect. He is not merely going over the same territory,
he is consciously emulating Napoleon.</p>

<p>The French Emperor’s excuse for attacking Russia was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Alexander refused to join Napoleon’s blockade of England, the
“Continental System.” Historians now agree, however, that Napoleon
went into Russia in 1812 chiefly to satisfy his vanity and his
lust for war and to appease his jealousy of Alexander, his only
remaining rival on the continent. Alexander was willing to do
almost everything Napoleon wanted, but Napoleon wanted to
impose his will by force. So with Hitler. He had even less excuse
than Napoleon for attacking Russia.</p>

<p>I share the opinion of many observers that Hitler could have had
anything he liked from Stalin, beginning with the delivery of all
available materials even if it meant stripping the Russians, and
including the permission to pass troops through Russia, and even
including perhaps consent to as much of a demobilization of the
Red Army as Stalin believed he could order without danger of
revolt&mdash;possibly enough to have satisfied Hitler that the Red Army
could not attack him. Nor does it seem likely that the Red Army
ever would have attacked the Germans except after they had
definitely lost the war in the West, and then it would have made
little difference who delivered the final blow.</p>

<p>The Russians would probably have behaved toward Germany
exactly as the Italians behaved toward France. In their anxiety to
run no risks, the Italians waited until their intervention made no
difference; the French were already defeated. So Stalin would probably
have waited until the German Army was knocked out before
he moved.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But wasn’t it likely that Stalin would have attacked if Hitler
attempted to invade the British Isles?</em></p>

<p>A. Not unless it had become apparent that the invasion had not
only failed but that the German Army had lost practically all its
Air Force and was about to collapse. If this contention is correct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
there was no danger to Hitler from the Russians, and the material
supplies he seeks could certainly have been obtained in greater
quantity by peaceful coercion than by war.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You have given us quite a number of strong points of the Soviet
Union. Can you outline its weak points?</em></p>

<p>A. Without pleasure. It is no pleasure to expose the demerits of a
force which for the time being, at any rate, is fighting against our
major enemy, and has fought gallantly and has lost more blood than
all the other opponents of our enemy put together. Yet it seems
to me useful always to keep our eyes open and to know as much
as we can about the characteristics of friend and foe and especially
of the sort of ally which has the ambiguous role of the Soviet Union
toward both Britain and America, neither friend nor foe, but possessed
merely of the same enemy.</p>

<p>The fundamental weakness of the Soviet Union and the root of
all its evil is the fact that the Bolsheviks believe and practice as
their first rule of political conduct that the end justifies the means.
This rule led to adoption of the Terror as the chief weapon in the
struggle to establish Socialism, and the Terror in turn made it
impossible to establish Socialism. The Terror destroyed democracy.
Without political democracy, the vaunted economic democracy of
the Soviet Union became a farce. Constant coercion of the masses
through the Terror benumbed them. Production was concentrated
on war materials and the output of consumption goods never rose
above subsistence level. The Soviet Union became a permanent
pauper state. The level from the standpoint of culture and comfort
remained barbarian, but the Russians showed they had the virtues
of barbarians. When the time came to fight they proved they could
stand up better to their Nazi brother barbarians than any of the
civilized folk of Europe.</p>

<p>The principle that the end justifies the means works in wartime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
as it is a barbarous principle and war is a barbarous business, and
that is one reason why the Russians have done as well as they have
against the Germans. In peacetime the principle that the end justifies
the means defeats itself because peaceful processes are not
promoted by violence. The Bolsheviks used the Terror to force
every member of the vast community of Russia into a pattern of
National Planned Economy, but after thirteen years of watching
the Five-Year plans, now in the midst of the Third, we can scan the
whole Russian scene and soberly observe that National Planned
Terror plus Bolshevik zeal have not been able to produce anything
like as much for the whole population as free capitalist economy
running on the profit motive with a competitive labor market. I
am not for Hoover capitalism, but even it is incomparably better
than Stalin’s economy.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What authority have you to speak about Russia?</em></p>

<p>A. Possibly no authority, but a good deal of experience. I was
for two years a correspondent in Moscow, from 1925 to 1927&mdash;that
was during the NEP&mdash;and thereafter made three long trips
and visited every part of the country from Vladivostok to Odessa
and Leningrad to Tiflis. I was the first correspondent to visit the
huge industrial plants of the First Five-Year Plan from the Urals to
the Caucasus, and after a 17,000-mile trip which lasted three months
I wrote a series of twenty-four articles, which were given a Pulitzer
prize. That was in 1930, and I made another study trip in 1934
and another in 1937. I keep up as well as one can by diligent reading
and contact with friends fresh from the Soviet Union and it
appears that the conditions there today, aside from the war, are
about as they were when I was last there. Most capitalist critics of
the Soviet Union oppose it because it has done away with the institution
of private property and of profit, and substituted a collectivist
system. It would not make much difference to these capitalist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
critics whether the Soviet collectivist system worked or not.
What irks them is that it has eliminated the form of economic
organization which has enabled them to become well to do.</p>

<p>This is not of any interest to me. The only thing that interests
me about the Soviet collectivist system is whether it works
or not. If it works better than ours, to bring more happiness to
everybody in the community than our system, then let us have it.
But the trouble with the Soviet collectivist system is that it simply
does not work to make men happier. It’s only success has been to
make men fight. That is what we need now, but it is not enough.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Can you prove that the Soviet system does not work?</em></p>

<p>A. I am not going to try to do it with statistics. I have played and
worked and sweated with Soviet statistics as much as the next man,
but if there ever was a country on earth where the old saying,
“Figures don’t lie but liars figure,” is true, it is the Soviet Union,
where avowedly and openly it is announced that the Statistical
Office must consider itself in the service of propaganda for the
national good. I can give you only a reproduction of the impressions
I had, and which you would have had if you had been with
me.</p>

<p>The two chief impressions you get from the Soviet Union are
its extreme poverty and the all-pervading Terror. True, the Terror
diminishes as one gets away from Moscow and the large cities, but
it is present in greater or less degree everywhere. The population as
a whole is desperately poor and always afraid. I thought when I
read of the German attack on the Soviet Union, and then of the
valiant initial Soviet resistance, that the war must have come to the
Soviet population as a sort of release.</p>

<p>Although “the NKVD instituted severe police measures to round
up Fifth Columnists,” nevertheless the net effect of the impact of
the war upon the Soviet population must have been very much like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the opening of jail doors. The national emergency and the necessity
for all to get together and fight for their lives, I am sure had an
inspiriting effect even greater than it would have in a less primitive
Western community. That wartime spirit of exaltation is not true
of the Soviet Union in peacetime. In ordinary times, the Soviet
population is surely the unhappiest 200,000,000 ever to live under
one flag in one vast succession of barracks and slums covering one-sixth
of the land surface of the globe and stretching from the Arctic
Ocean to the Black Sea and from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Baltic.
Think of that immense area with its huge population and reflect
that from one end of the country to the other there cannot be
found a single household (aside from those of high Soviet officials,
and a few artists, journalists, and other privileged classes&mdash;not more
than a few thousand out of 200,000,000) possessing the food,
clothing, furniture, the necessities and conveniences of an ordinary
workman’s family in the United States.</p>

<p>After two years of warfare and bombing and blockade it would
be difficult to find in all England a workman compelled to live as
uncomfortably, unhygienically, and with as poor food and clothing
as the ordinary Moscow workman. The average family on relief
in America lives better than the privileged Moscow workman’s
family. I particularly emphasize “Moscow workman” because he
is the best-off person in the Soviet Union with the exception of the
tiny privileged group I have mentioned. The revolution was made
for the proletariat and what there is to enjoy goes to the workman.</p>

<p>The peasants on their collective farms live on the whole on a
level beneath that of any large group of white people in the world.
The Soviet peasant’s condition is substantially that of a serf. He is
bound to his collective and may not leave without permission. He
is paid chiefly in kind and his pittance of cash is almost useless, since
there are such small supplies of anything in the stores to buy.
He eats day in and day out, year in and year out, for breakfast,
dinner, and supper black bread and cabbage soup and little else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<p>The average Russian peasant does not taste meat more than a
few times a year. He is able to live on this diet because his black
rye bread contains everything necessary for complete nutrition save
fat, which he gets from a meager ration of salt pork. His relationship
to the collective is the relationship of serf to master. The serf
under the Czar could be punished by his master; so can the Soviet
serf be punished by the NKVD, without trial, and whereas under
the Czar the landowner had no power of life and death over his
serfs, the NKVD has that power not only over the peasants but
over every human being in the Soviet Union except Stalin himself
and his immediate cohorts.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>If the peasant is such a serf, why has he not revolted now that
the advance of Hitler’s armies has given him a chance to do so?</em></p>

<p>A. It may sound flippant but it is the sober truth that the Russian
peasant serf does not know that he is a serf; he is convinced that he
lives better than any farm hand in the world. He has utterly no
standard of comparison. He is as incapable of judging his position in
the world as the Eskimos in <em>Kabloona</em> who had never seen a white
man until Gontran de Poncins visited them. The Russian peasant
is as shut off from the outside world as an inhabitant of old Japan
before Perry. Within his world he has no neighbors better off than
himself. This makes him a happier man than if he were able to
observe and become envious of more pleasant ways of life.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What is the NKVD?</em></p>

<p>A. That is the name given the Soviet Political Police in 1934. It has
had three names, first the Cheka, then the G.P.U., pronounced Gay
Pay Oo, and now NKVD, pronounced En Kah Vay Day, which
is an abbreviation for the <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Narkomvnudel</i>, itself an abbreviation of
four Russian words meaning Peoples Commissariat of Internal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Affairs. Whenever the Political Police has accumulated too much
blood on its name, it is changed, but its functions remain the same:
to administer the Terror.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Are the people in the collective farms better off than when they
were individual farmers?</em></p>

<p>A. I did not know the Russia of the Czars, but the peasant himself
gave a very good answer to that when he refused to go into the
collectives, and rather than enter with his livestock, killed it by
the thousands of head, until within a year more than half the cattle,
horses, pigs, and sheep of the country had been slaughtered. The
Soviet Union has not yet entirely recovered from this animal
massacre. The peasants slaughtered their livestock because once collectivized,
the livestock passed completely out of control of the
peasants. Stalin later conceded each collective farm peasant the
right to own one cow and one pig as his private possession. Otherwise
the members of the collective may not dispose of the product
of their own toil.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But isn’t that precisely the nature of a collective, for all members
to pool their resources and labor and then draw the dividends?</em></p>

<p>A. That is the theory, but the dividends for the Soviet peasant
consist of the barest subsistence. They must turn over to the State
trusts a stipulated amount or share of whatever their collective
produces, wheat, or dairy products, beef or pork, and this share is
usually so high that there is nothing left for the peasants to eat
but black bread and cabbage. It is the settled policy of the Five-Year
Plans to take from the soil all its produce except the minimum
subsistence for the peasants and devote it to industrialization, by
distribution at high prices to the workmen, and by export, in
exchange for machines from abroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Then, surely the Russian workman is much better off, since the
whole system is supposed to be for the benefit of the proletariat.</em></p>

<p>A. He is better off than the peasant, but he is worse off than any
other white workman in the world. In the winter of 1934-1935 I
made a survey of the Russian standard of living and compared it
with the standard of living in capitalist states. In order to make the
comparison as fair as possible I chose the little capitalist states which
used to be a part of Imperial Russia&mdash;Finland, Esthonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, and Poland.</p>

<p>First I spent two months in Moscow, studying the standard of
living of the workmen in the best Moscow factories. These workmen
were more favorably situated than any others in the Soviet
Union. Then I spent three months studying the standard of living
of typical working-class families in the little capitalist states. To my
surprise I found that the poorest workmen’s families in the capitalist
states lived considerably better than the Moscow workers, who
were the most prosperous in all Russia.</p>

<p>This was after seventeen years of Communism, and the capitalist
states used for comparison were among the poorest in the world.
They had all suffered more from the World War than Russia as a
whole had suffered, and they began their new national lives from
scratch, without capital or credit. Yet the average workman in Finland,
Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland was living at least
twice as well as the best-off workmen in the Soviet Union.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How did you get your facts?</em></p>

<p>A. By visiting scores of homes and talking with the housewives.
I asked each one fifty to a hundred questions, and found out the
total family income, how it was earned, and how it was spent. Then
I made up a theoretical basket, to contain a week’s supply of food
for a workman, and found out by direct inquiry the number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
hours a man would have to work to earn the basket. I found that
in order to buy the basket the Soviet workman had to spend an
average of twice as many working hours as his fellow worker in
the small capitalistic states, while he would have to spend over three
times as many working hours as a workman in the United States.</p>

<p>The Moscow workers, as the workers in most parts of the Soviet
Union, live in barracks, one or more families to a room, brutally
overcrowded. The Soviet Union has never succeeded in solving
its housing problem and seems, indeed, to be slipping steadily
backward, each year jamming more and more people into tenements
fantastically full. It is not unusual to find four families sharing
a single room. Imagine how much privacy they have, with each
family’s quarter of the room partitioned off by a hanging sheet.
In the little capitalist states, many workmen had their own cottage
homes, a thing utterly unknown in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The food eaten by the capitalist workmen was incomparably
better in quality and greater in quantity than the Soviet workman’s
food. The clothing worn by the Soviet workmen and their families
was pathetically threadbare, sleazy and cheap, while the capitalist
workmen were well-dressed in comparison. Now these Russian
workmen, it must be remembered, were in the midst of their Second
Five-Year Plan, and were the recipients of the cream of its production.
They were the beneficiaries of that vast scheme of National
Planned Economy which was to produce so much more efficiently
than the capitalist system that before long everybody in the Soviet
Union would be living like rich men in the United States. It was
their idea that the time would soon come when production of every
conceivable kind of commodity would be so prolific in the Soviet
Union that everybody could have his every material want satisfied.
“From each according to his ability&mdash;to each according to his need,”
the classic Communist ideal would be finally attained.</p>

<p>Now after twenty-three years of trial it seems certain that in
place of Soviet State Capitalism, any form of private capitalism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
under a democracy would have given Russia not only the blessings
of individual liberty, but far greater industrial production, which of
course is the prime measure of any economic system’s success. This
is not a mere speculation. If you take the graph of Imperialist Russian
industrial production before the last war, and prolong it over
the next twenty-three years at the same rate of increase as the years
1900 to 1914, you will find that Czarist Russia would have produced
more in 1940 than the Soviet Union with all its Five-Year
Plans. What Russia could have accomplished under a liberal democratic,
or a free democratic-socialist regime, we can only guess.</p>

<p>Both Lenin and Trotzky once remarked that no matter what
else the Soviet Union did, if it did not succeed in producing more
than the capitalist system produced, the Soviet system must be
called a failure. If it is objected that the Soviet Union had to spend
its surplus on defense, one can reply that a system which is so poor
that the population has to live on a bare subsistence level in order
to maintain its armed services, is a failure also. Twenty-three years
is a long enough trial for any system to show at least some hope.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What is State Capitalism and what has this to do with the war?</em></p>

<p>A. It has a great deal to do with the war, because Soviet weakness
tempted Hitler to attack and Soviet weakness is a direct outcome of
Soviet State Capitalism. This term means that the State is the
monopolizer of all industry, trade, and agriculture. It is the sole
employer. It is the owner and manager of all factories, mines, shops,
farms, fisheries, transport systems, in short of every means of production
and distribution in the country.</p>

<p>No one can work for any other employer except the State and
the State has absolute power to order every minute detail of the
daily lives of its employees, the whole population. The Soviet workman
is no less a serf than the Soviet peasant, for the workman also
cannot leave his job without permission, and he also has no control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of any kind over his employer, no means of bringing pressure on
him, because his employer is the State and the State is not elected,
but its representatives are appointed from the top down, beginning
with Stalin.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You say the State is not elected, but how about the Soviet elections
we hear about?</em></p>

<p>A. The voters are presented with a ticket chosen by the Party and
they are allowed to accept the Party candidates. Citizens of the
Soviet Union have exactly as much voice in their government as
citizens of Nazi Germany have in theirs, that is, none at all. It is
nevertheless interesting to note that the tyrant in the Soviet Union
still thinks it worth while to preserve the farce of elections while
the tyrant in Germany has apparently dispensed with them altogether.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But cannot the Soviet workmen bring pressure to bear on the
authorities by striking?</em></p>

<p>A. Strikes have been outlawed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i> in the Soviet Union since
its earliest years. Soviet trades unions are merely the instruments
for helping the State enforce discipline. They are the classic type
of company unions. We can sum up this aspect of Soviet State Capitalism
by saying that whereas this form of collectivism was intended
originally to free the workman from all the disabilities, injustices,
and inequalities suffered by the workman under the individual
capitalist employer, all that has happened is that the workman has
exchanged a comparatively weak, sometimes well-meaning, individual
or corporate capitalist employer for a monster, all-powerful,
completely egocentric, impersonal, soulless monopoly, the
State, which has all the faults of the worst individual employer
multiplied a millionfold. It is just as greedy as the worst individual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
but has no check upon its greed, and it is never as efficient as the
least efficient individual. It is Jack London’s Iron Heel in reverse.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>It was the original Bolshevik theory, was it not, that their
Planned National Economy would be superior to Unplanned Capitalist
Economy because it would prevent the cyclic recurrence of
economic crises, such as 1929-1930? It was to end all booms and
depressions by ending overproduction. Hasn’t the Soviet Union
done at least that much?</em></p>

<p>A. We cannot tell, because the Soviet Union has never, in the
twenty-three years of its existence, had anything like sufficient
production, much less overproduction.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why couldn’t the Soviet Planned Economy succeed?</em></p>

<p>A. We can split the total failure into five parts: First, failure
adequately to replace the profit system; second, failure of planned
production; third, failure of planned distribution; fourth, failure
of the monetary system; fifth, failure of Soviet construction to keep
up with deterioration. Behind all these four failures looms the black
father of them all, the Terror.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why do you devote so much importance to the Soviet Terror?</em></p>

<p>A. From having witnessed its importance in the Soviet Union.
Aside from that, we ought to be able to recognize purely theoretically
its paramount role in any attempt swiftly to transform an
individualistic society into a collectivist society. For thousands of
years men have been living more or less free individual lives. Suddenly
it is decided to create a collective, as the Bolsheviks decided
in Russia. At the time of the Revolution there were said to have
been no more than ten thousand Bolsheviks. Eventually they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
to impose their will upon 200,000,000 people and reorganize them
into a vast, badly functioning, but nevertheless authentic anthill.
To do this as swiftly as the Bolsheviks wanted it done required
compulsion, applied without stint, to every unit in the ant heap.
Having no say in the matter these multitudes of human beings were
required to change every habit of their lives; were ordered even to
change their instincts. It took unlimited compulsion to achieve a
semblance of the goal. The instrument of compulsion was the
Terror.</p>

<p>It produced an ant heap, but the ant heap never was able to do
more than provide minimum food, lodging, and clothing for its
ants. For a long time outside observers leniently agreed that this
must be due to the strain of reorganizing an individualistic into a
collectivist society, but now that a generation has passed, the tendency
is to consider that more fundamental faults are to blame.</p>

<p>First, it appeared that the motive for work was not so effective
in the ant heap as it was in the outside world, since from the day
of its foundation until this moment the Soviet workman has produced
less per capita per hour than capitalist workmen anywhere
in the world. Furthermore, higher ranks, as engineers, technicians,
superintendents, managers, and directors in the Soviet Union were
so notably inefficient compared with their capitalist colleagues that
for a time the anthill authorities imported and paid highly trained
specialists from the outside world to set an example and teach.</p>

<p>This effort too was a failure, as Soviet production usually declined
to its original level after departure of the foreign specialist.
Also the men of enterprise who in a free society risk their capital
and brains to found factories, dig mines, and sometimes swindle
their fellow men, were assigned in the anthill to the Gosplan, the
Government Planning Commission. There, in the effort to plan
production for 200,000,000 people, the anthill failed most dismally.
The conclusion was that the collective with its rigid wage scales,
limited incomes, prohibited labor market, and ban on profits had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
not provided a motive for work as stimulating and productive as
the profit motive and the competitive wage system in the free capitalist
world.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How can you call it a free capitalist world? There isn’t any
freedom left in the capitalist world. Look at all the checks on business
here in the United States. Do you consider our farmers free?
They can’t even plant what they want.</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, I call it free, as free as bird life compared with the Soviet
Union or with Nazi Germany. The trouble with you and with all
of us who complain about the checks on business, on agriculture,
and so on, is that we lack the experience of being really without
freedom. Unless you have lived in a slave state, under a real
tyranny, you simply do not know what freedom means. All these
checks about which you complain are legal checks imposed by law
made by representatives of your choosing and passed upon by
courts which are eventually also of your choosing, and drawn
within a constitution which was also chosen and is now maintained
by the people’s free will. If you dislike any of these checks, you
have only to get a majority to agree with you and you can change
it. To compare the lack of absolute freedom in our world with the
absolute lack of freedom in the totalitarian world, whether Bolshevik
or Nazi, is the same as to compare a traffic policeman with
the warden of a penitentiary.</p>

<p>It was precisely this effort at penitentiary production on a continental
scale that broke down the Russian effort at planned national
economy. It proved impossible to plan effectively for so enormous
an aggregate of human beings every detail of their production. A
few of the population, perhaps two per cent, were zealous Communists
who were willing to work harder to make the collective
successful than they would have worked for any amount of profit.</p>

<p>Terror was used to make the other ninety-eight per cent fit in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
and work. But the Terror took away from the managers, supervisors,
and technicians the willingness to take responsibility. A mistake,
honest though it might be, could cost a factory manager his
life. In the Soviet Union the man who makes a mistake is automatically
suspected and accused of sabotage. The only way to be safe
is to make no decisions, pass every responsibility to a higher
authority. This is the rule today throughout the Soviet economic
apparatus.</p>

<p>Parallel with this effect of the Terror is the benumbing influence
of the unforgiving rigidity of the Plan. Each factory manager is
given a quota to fulfill. Quotas are calculated at a trifle more than
normal maximum capacity. No excuses are accepted for nonfulfillment.
In the chaos of Soviet economic life it is seldom that raw
materials, fuel, tools, and labor can easily be brought together to
fulfill a quota, yet failure may cost the factory manager “liquidation,”
which means anything from dismissal or exile at hard labor
to death.</p>

<p>Consequently, nearly all quotas are fulfilled in quantity, but
quality is in practice ignored. The number of units of production
is easily checked; quality is more difficult to check. Hence, Soviet
industrial production is lower in quality than in the capitalist world,
and this is a partial explanation for the divergence between Soviet
industrial statistics which show a high level of production, and the
facts of Soviet economic life which demonstrate to the naked eye
how low the level of production is. Some observers have estimated
that at least thirty per cent should be taken off all Soviet industrial
production statistics to allow for the quantities of entirely unusable
goods produced.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But we used to prize highly many objects of Russian manufacture,
and you can still see in jewelry and antique stores all kinds of
finely made things, enamel work, and leather goods, wonderfully
printed books. What has become of them?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span></p>

<p>A. Nearly all that fine handicraft is gone now. The Russian artisan
used to be one of the best in the world. Home handicrafts formerly
supplied a sizable fraction of Russian consumption goods, not only
the things you mention, but furniture, pottery, textiles&mdash;wonderful
hand-woven linen and wool&mdash;and lacquer work. Most of these
artisans, or such of them as outlived the hardships of the Revolution,
have been forced into factories today to turn out mass production
articles inferior to any in the world, including the
Japanese.</p>

<p>I often wonder what a Moscow citizen would say if he could
walk through an American five-and-ten-cent store. I am sure he
would think he was being deceived. He could not imagine such a
wealth of high-grade, luxurious articles. Once one of the younger
members of the Rosenwald clan visited Moscow and as we looked
in the pitiful shopwindows I remarked that if he wanted to start a
revolution in Russia all he would have to do would be to distribute
a few million Sears Roebuck catalogues among the workers and
peasants of the greatest poorhouse in history. Such a system of
nationwide mail-order distribution would be utterly beyond the
comprehension of a Soviet citizen, for one of the weakest links in
the weak chain of Soviet economy is the distribution of goods.</p>

<p>Poor as the goods are, they are not so poor as the method of
putting them in the hands of the consumers. Since there is always
a goods shortage, the consumer is placed in the permanent position
of a supplicant, glad to get anything even if it is a substitute for a
substitute for the article he wants. Allocation of the scanty supplies
is made from the top down. The local community is not
asked what it needs. The Planners arbitrarily ship certain quantities
of shoes, hoe handles, and seed, and the recipients have
learned to be grateful, no matter if what they needed was kerosene,
matches, and cloth.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But you said something about the monetary system, that it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
failed too. How can a monetary system fail in a completely planned
national economy?</em></p>

<p>A. The monetary system under the Soviets seems just as difficult
to handle as it is in the capitalist system. The authorities incessantly
juggle wages against prices, raising the one, lowering the other,
inflating the currency, selling bonds and even lottery bonds, as
blatantly gambling as the old Louisiana lottery. Yet the answer
never seems to be achieved satisfactorily. Always the citizen’s purchasing
power is behind his needs. Fundamentally, of course, the
answer is that there is never enough of anything to go around.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But isn’t the answer to that the fact that the Soviet State is
taking away from the citizens today in order to invest in productive
industry from which the citizens will draw a dividend tomorrow?
At least I should have thought that was the theory.</em></p>

<p>A. That is the theory, but one of the tragic aspects of the epic
struggle of the Russian Bolsheviks to make their collectivist system
work is that their investments in factories and machinery wear out
almost as fast and sometimes faster than they can replace them and
build new ones. The bad workmanship of the buildings and the
poor quality and rough handling of the machines results in a speed
of deterioration far beyond the normal in the capitalist world. If
they had given their population slightly better food and living
conditions and had therefore been compelled to limit their investment
in new buildings and machines to something like a capitalist
standard of new investment, deterioration would probably have
taken away more plant than they could replace.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How do you explain such inefficiency and wastefulness?</em></p>

<p>A. For all the reasons given before, and for another which I left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
for a different category since it is, so to speak, historical, while
these reasons we have discussed are current. The historical fact of
import at least during the life of this generation is that the Bolsheviks
twice in twenty years exterminated their ablest people in
the country, or rather I should say, the Bolsheviks first killed off
the ablest people of old Russia and then Stalin killed off the ablest
Bolsheviks. It has been so long ago, and the popular interest and
sympathy in the Soviet experiment was at the time so great, that
we have almost forgotten what the Bolsheviks did to their own
countrymen.</p>

<p>Their conviction was that they could not establish Communism,
or Socialism, without physically exterminating the persons who
had become, under capitalism, better off than the mass of the
people. They reasoned that no capitalist, and by that they meant
any person who lived a little better than the poorest member of the
community, would ever tolerate willingly the establishment of a
Socialist State. They believed all such people would attempt to
wreck the new Socialist economy. The professional revolutionaries
had spent half their lives attempting to wreck the capitalist system,
and they attributed to the capitalists a similar resolution.</p>

<p>In Germany, the Nazis succeeded in coercing the capitalists into
becoming useful members of the National Socialist Collective. In
Russia, the Bolsheviks set out to destroy the capitalists as a class,
or rather every human being who by his birth, or position, or
accomplishment, had become identified as an active member of the
old system. First, they killed off the aristocracy and landed proprietors,
numbering several hundred thousand, and including of
course the Czar and his family. Then they exterminated the industrialists,
not very numerous, because Russia was the least industrialized
of the great nations. Nevertheless they were important.
With them a little later were exterminated the managers, supervisors
and technicians, the scientists, the professional men, dentists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
surgeons, lawyers, teachers, and judges. These numbered a million
or more.</p>

<p>By the time I got to Russia in 1925 all these were fully exterminated.
By extermination I mean just that. They were either shot,
or sent into exile in the Arctic or the deserts of Central Asia, or
condemned to penal labor under such conditions that they died
within a few years. They were nearly all killed. Only the most
meager remnant remained, a few accidents of survival. I shall never
forget the man who peddled cigarettes. I shared a house in Moscow
with Theo Seibert, correspondent of the <cite>Hamburger Fremdenblatt</cite>,
today, alas, editor of the <cite>Voelkischer Beobachter</cite>. Theo and
I used to try to get the old man to talk, but he was too frightened
to make much sense. The baldheaded trembling man who begged
us to buy his cigarettes had been a Justice of the Moscow Supreme
Court! His survival was just an accident.</p>

<p>After this initial massacre the Bolsheviks let a pause ensue and
for several years no great killings took place, just the routine score
or so of executions per month. But when the Five-Year Plan was
inaugurated, the decision was made to exterminate the kulaks. A
kulak was the term applied originally to a peasant who had risen
sufficiently above his neighbors to employ labor. That made him an
exploiter, a person who lived from the surplus value produced by
his hired hands. The Bolsheviks, however, chose to amplify this
category to include all peasants who, even if they did not employ
labor, had become in the least degree more prosperous than their
neighbors. This prosperity, based for the most part upon the
individual industry and sagacity of the kulak, might consist in the
possession of two cows to the neighbor’s one. In any case the reasoning
of the Bolsheviks was that they could not afford to tolerate
the existence of any peasant who, forced to join a collective farm,
would at the beginning have to live worse than he had lived as an
individual farmer.</p>

<p>Such peasants, the Bolsheviks reasoned, would be just as incorrigible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
enemies to collectivism as the aristocrats and industrialists.
They had to die. They did die. This was the greatest Soviet mass
slaughter, because there were a great many more such peasants
than there were aristocrats, or industrialists, or intelligentsia. It
took about two years to do away with the kulaks. Tens of thousands
of G.P.U. troops and agents sought out every family of
better-than-average peasants throughout the entire Soviet Union,
and forced them into boxcars and herded them off to places of
exile, down to Kazakstan or up to Narimsky Krai, to places where
it was too hot or too cold to live. It is a conservative estimate to
say that some 5,000,000 of these more enterprising farm workers
and their families died at once, or within a few years.</p>

<p>This process destroyed what there was left of the originally non-Communist
party talent in Russia. You would have thought that
this ought to satisfy the Bolsheviks. It did, but it did not satisfy
Stalin. There was no more opposition to the Bolshevik program.
There was not a human being left in Russia who had any connection
with the old regime. Not in modern history has there been
such a clean wiping of the slate. The Bolsheviks were left not only
as absolute masters, but containing a country in which every living
person was their hopeful or cowed collaborator. Then came the
fatal quarrel between Stalin and Trotzky. Out of this quarrel came
the great purges by Stalin which destroyed for the second time
within a generation the principal talent of Russia.</p>

<p>This may be regarded as the most fateful slaughter of all. Bolsheviks
could argue that the extermination of every vestige of
Czarist Russia could be justified on account of the inefficiency,
inhumanity, unproductivity of the old regime, and the fact that,
according to Bolshevik reasoning, members of the old regime
would never cooperate with the new. But now Stalin was destroying
not the old, but the new regime, all its talents, its best intellects,
its best characters if you like.</p>

<p>Beginning with the politicians, he killed off in the course of four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
years of uninterrupted purges, the top fourth or fifth, to estimate
it conservatively, of the Party itself, of the Army, Navy, and Air
Force leaders and then of the new Bolshevik intelligentsia, the
foremost technicians, managers, supervisors, scientists. There is, of
course, enough youth among 200,000,000 for the nation to recover
even after such a purge. The youth whom Stalin spared have
proved in battle how boundless are the forces of Russia, the first
country Hitler ever tackled with lives to waste!</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You have not made it clear, if the Soviet system is so brutal a
tyranny, how it is that the Red Army has been able to stand up so
well to the Germans.</em></p>

<p>A. The answer is that the Red Army has fought as Russians have
always fought under any regime, bravely, enduringly, stubbornly,
gallantly. Russians have always had to fight despite their government;
as they did in the last war, as they are doing in this war. The
general distaste of the outside world for the Bolshevik system led
many to forget that the Russian soldier retains in the Red Army
all the martial virtues he possessed in the past. And have we forgotten
that the Imperial Army in the last war held the Germans
for three years? If the Red Army does as well we will be eternally
thankful. True, the Germans in the last war had to divide their
forces into two fronts, while today the Red Army has to bear the
shock of nearly the full force of the whole German land forces.
The task of the Red Army is accordingly heavier.</p>

<p>But our appraisal of the Red Army’s resistance has been strongly
influenced by an element which has colored and distorted our
judgment of the quality of any army which faces the Germans.
That element is our recollection of the collapse of the French
Army, which was due to a score of causes besides the excellence of
the German Army. It was so overwhelming, bewildering, and
impressive that it gave rise to the involuntary, subconscious feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
that the Germans were invincible. Now when any troops stand up
to the Germans we are inclined to judge it a miracle of valor and
military effectiveness. This is not to take away one whit of the
immense credit due the Russians for holding up Hitler’s juggernaut
but it is fair to point out that if we had not seen France fall,
if for example Germany had attacked Russia before attacking
France, everybody would have expected the Russians to put up
just about the resistance they have put up. After all, Russia is a
nation of double the population of Germany, with incomparably
greater natural resources, and with twenty-three years of unflagging
preparation for precisely this war. If there had been the
exceptional virtue in the Soviet collectivist system which is ascribed
to it by its disciples in America, it should not merely have stopped
but should have defeated, routed, and conquered the Germans.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Aside from the fact that everybody was influenced by the
French example, most military experts seem to have been deceived
about the fighting ability of the Red Army. Why was that?</em></p>

<p>A. It seemed almost as though Stalin wanted the outside world to
think his army less strong than it was. None but the most acute of
professional observers, among them Colonel Faymonville, for years
American military attaché to Moscow, and now a member of the
Allied military mission there, had a correct view of the Red Army.
Hitler for the first time in his life admitted he had “had no idea”
how strong the Red Army was. No outsider was ever allowed to
see more than fragments of it. No newspaper correspondent, for
example, ever put foot over the threshold of a Red Army barracks.
Maneuvers were nearly always carried out in secret without the
presence of military attachés. One almost had the feeling that
Stalin had deliberately arranged the initial debacle of his attack on
Finland in the first Soviet-Finnish war in order to deceive the
world into thinking his army inferior to its real strength. Of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
that makes no sense, and the fact was that Stalin had been led to
think he could walk over Finland with ease and hence had not
properly prepared his attack. Nevertheless the net effect of the first
Finnish war combined with the secrecy thrown about the Red
Army was to make even military attachés in observation posts
around Russia believe the Red Army extremely weak. There was
always the greatest difficulty in obtaining the most elementary
facts about the Red Army. The Soviet government published less
about its military establishment than any other great power. It kept
concealed the very existence of important armaments factories; it
never published production figures in the arms industry; it furnished
the League of Nations less information about its vast army
than any other members of the League. The G.P.U. Terror made
it possible to envelop the Red Army in an impenetrable blanket
which even the Germans were not able to pierce.</p>

<p>This secrecy emphasized the surprise that many felt at the outbreak
of the war, when the Soviet economy was now indisputably
revealed to have been a totally one-purpose economy, for the
single end of making war. Every student of the Soviet Union had
realized the great emphasis laid upon national defense, but everyone
had supposed that at the same time the Soviet Planners were
working primarily, if ineffectively, to create a thousand-purpose
economy for the satisfaction of the myriad needs of the population.
No one had divined what turned out to be the fact, that this huge
economy was being organized for nothing but fighting.</p>

<p>It proved effective, as was to be expected. A brutal, simplified
economy which ignores most of the people’s wants and devotes all
its energy and materials to preparing for war, is better able to prepare
and to make war than a more complete economy devoted to
satisfying its people’s peacetime needs. Sparta was stronger in battle
than Athens, but should we measure the value of a society by the
efficiency with which it makes war? If so, we ought to value the
Nazis above all others, since they are still leading in this activity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Hitler’s society took Sparta as its model; Stalin’s took Spartacus.
The Nazis met their identical twin when they struck the Red
Army in battle. Hitler wishes us to believe he is crusading against
a fundamentally different regime in a “crusade for civilization.”
We shall not be deceived.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What would be the result if Stalin were really to try to hold
out indefinitely? Could he do so? Has he the resources in the Urals
to carry on there?</em></p>

<p>A. He has almost everything he needs in the Urals except sufficient
oil. If he were cut off from oil in the Caucasus, he would have to
import supplies over the trans-Siberian, already overburdened.
If he really were determined to carry on in spite of all odds, and
could make Sverdlovsk or Cheliabinsk another Chungking, it
would compel Hitler to keep an important fraction of his total
forces in action in Russia; it would probably prevent Hitler from
being able to attempt to invade England; it would lead to a deadlock
which could be turned into victory by our intervention.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Would it be possible for us to supply the Russians with sufficient
to make up for their losses? Could we enable them to carry
on?</em></p>

<p>A. Our shipments to Russia are as important morally as materially;
indeed their token strength is greater than their real strength. We
shall never be able to make up for the territory Russia has lost to
the Germans&mdash;60 per cent of their steel supply, 45 per cent of their
manganese, 49 per cent of their tire production, and so on. Our
shipments will always be limited by the transportation facilities of
the trans-Siberian railway and the route through Iran, both of
which are long and time-consuming. Actually we can scarcely
hope to get enough American supplies in the hands of the Red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Army to make much real difference before next spring, no matter
how hard we try, and we ought to do our best. It is the publicly
announced policy of both Washington and London that Russia
shall have priority on the vital war materials. But everything is up
to Stalin. If he wishes to quit and announce that he had not
received sufficient aid from Britain and the United States, he will
be able to do so any time during the next several months, and make
a case at least among his friends.</p>

<p>If Stalin decides to hold on, we have a two to one chance to beat
Hitler in the long run; if he decides to quit it means we face much
worse odds. There is only one way we can persuade him that we
are going to put our full powers into the struggle. It is our crystal-clear
duty to ourselves, our children, and our national future to
keep Stalin in the war by ourselves going formally to war against
Germany. It is a crime against America to wait.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">3. ENGLAND</h2>
</div>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What place do you think Churchill will have in history?</em></p>

<p>A. If Churchill brings his country victorious out of this war, he
will without a doubt go down as the greatest man in English history.
No Prime Minister of the sixty ministries since Walpole, and
none of the Monarchs when they exercised unlimited power, nor
any Admiral or General has upon his tombstone: “He saved England
from death.” Many have saved England from defeat. Many
have added to England’s power and glory. But only Churchill will
be entitled to the supreme rank, for never before has England been
threatened with the supreme penalty of national extinction. Among
the Prime Ministers Lloyd George would have a place near
Churchill, but the alternative to victory in the first World War
was not the alternative in this war. Among the defenders of England,
Nelson, Wellington, and the Great Duke of Marlborough
would rank near Churchill. But the alternative to victory against
Napoleon or Louis XIV was not the alternative England faces
now. And no England of the past ever faced such odds as Churchill
and his people faced at the fall of France. Whatever the decision,
Churchill has already achieved greatness. This man who used to
be accused of playing at politics and acting only for himself has
been lifted by his responsibility to forget himself in the Battle of
Mankind.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is Mr. Churchill really backed by all the British people?</em></p>

<p>A. Mr. Churchill is the most popular and trusted leader the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
people have had within the memory of living man. The man who
caused the defeat of the General Strike in 1926 is if anything more
popular among the working classes than among the upper classes.
In the House of Commons he usually receives heartier applause
from Labor members than from Conservatives even though he is
the head of the Conservative party. This is partly because the Conservatives
cannot rid themselves of a tinge of resentment at the
man who was always, consistently, unfailingly right about the
coming of the war, and what it would be like, while they were
always, consistently, unfailingly wrong. The Conservatives out of
a rooted misconception of the character and intentions of Hitler,
felt an instinctive sympathy for him almost up to the time he actually
began to drop bombs upon them. The Labor party on the
other hand shared Churchill’s antipathy for Hitler from the very
beginning, and there was thus early established a bond between
the great British aristocrat and the British working classes which
has been greatly strengthened by his leadership of the war. I doubt
if there is a single Labor party leader with as devoted a following
among the British workers as Churchill has.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What part in the war has the British workingman played under
Churchill’s leadership?</em></p>

<p>A. The British workingman, inspired and informed by Churchill,
has been superbly and intelligently patriotic. It is this union of
Churchill with Labor which has warded off defeat in the most
desperate hour, and which with our help will eventually win the
war. British Labor’s attitude toward the struggle which will decide
the fate of all the world for generations to come is a reproach to
that minority of American labor which has failed to understand
the fact that the liberty and the life of every individual American
workingman depends on the outcome of this war. During those
awful months following the evacuation of Dunkirk, the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
trades unions voluntarily gave up all the trades unions rules which,
designed to protect the interests of labor in peacetime, hampered
production and became a danger in war. They lengthened hours,
took less pay for more work, stayed on the job to the point of complete
exhaustion. In the course of about three months the British
workingman doubled the production of weapons and munitions,
and almost tripled airplane production by the end of the year. It
could not have been done without Churchill. From 1932 to 1939,
for seven years, Churchill had been tirelessly teaching, preaching,
exhorting, and pleading with the British public and the British
government to meet the German menace. By the time the war
came the British working classes had learned from Churchill what
it was about. They learned much faster than the Chamberlains and
many a muddleheaded rich appeaser.</p>

<p>Another impressive sign of the wisdom of the British Labor
Party from the leaders to the rank and file is that you do not hear
from them the demands for a “definition of war aims” which are so
loudly voiced by groups of American liberals. These Americans
who are so concerned about establishing the chemical purity of
British intentions, and who insist on a blueprint of the peace settlement,
and a guarantee that the world will be made over in a style
that meets with their approval&mdash;these Americans show precisely the
incomprehension of Hitler that Chamberlain showed with his
appeasement. Your ordinary British dock worker knows more
about the meaning of the war than scores of American intellectuals
who are still bleating about war aims. As the British Labor publicist,
G. D. H. Cole, put it, “The Labor leaders and the great
majority of their followers alike believed firmly that the defeat of
Hitler mattered immeasurably more than anything else. For this
reason they were ready to put aside even their socialism and the
greater part of their reforming policy and even to abstain from
criticizing openly the government’s mistakes rather than run any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
risk of dividing the national elements which stood for a vigorous
prosecution of the war.”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is Churchill what you would call a realist or an idealist?</em></p>

<p>A. Churchill is both. He is a hardheaded, tough-minded idealist
and an imaginative, generous realist. He is convinced that the
policy which works for the good of all will also work best for the
good of the individual. This is the foundation stone of civilization.
Hitler believes that the smart man is the man who exploits others.
Hitler’s are the ethics of the “heel,” the gangster, the racketeer,
the cheat who is always on the lookout for a chance to swindle, or
rob, betray, or murder for profit. The Churchill attitude is that of
the moral man, the member of society. The Hitler attitude is that
of the amoral man, the bandit preying upon society.</p>

<p>I do not think Churchill is formally a religious man, although he
attends divine services and thus sets an example for the nation
under his leadership. But Churchill’s beliefs add up to something
closely approaching practical Christianity. It seems to me that very
few Americans really understand what Churchill stands for. He is
so much in the public eye as a war leader, that we are bound to
think of him as a warrior first. We forget or never were told that
he is first of all a builder. Before the war, in the field of international
relations he believed passionately in the life-and-death
necessity of sustaining the League, of collective security through
the League.</p>

<p>Then as now, and in England as here in America, there were
great numbers of persons who thought they were being hardheaded
realists by rejecting the League as romantic. Their successors
today are our isolationists or noninterventionists, as they
shamefacedly call themselves now. Churchill remorselessly revealed
how suicidal was this refusal to cooperate among nations for the
maintenance of security for all. Long before Litvinoff coined the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
phrase Churchill was preaching that “peace is indivisible,” that
only through collective security could the security of any single
state be secured. His scorn for the British counterpart of our isolationists
was withering: “It is of the utmost consequence to the
unity of British national action that the policy of adhering to the
Covenant of the League of Nations shall not be weakened or
whittled away. I read in the <cite>Times</cite> a few days ago a letter in which
a gentleman showed that these ideas of preventing war by international
courts and by reasonable discussion had been tried over
and over again. He said they had been tried after Marlborough had
defeated Louis XIV and after Europe had defeated Napoleon, but,
he said, they had always failed. If that is true it is a melancholy
fact but what was astonishing was <em>the crazy glee</em> with which the
writer hailed such lapses from grace. I was told the other day of a
sentence of Carlyle’s in which he describes ‘the laugh of the hyena
on being assured that, after all, the world is only carrion.’”</p>

<p>It is of course plain to everybody now that the world is being
torn apart because <em>crazy</em> people prevented the League of Nations
from functioning, <em>crazy</em> people who believed they were as shrewd
as the Americans who today would like us to wait for the Germans
to land on United States soil before we fight. It has always been
considered by cheap and vulgar men that it is clever to be entirely
selfish, and so our Lindberghs, Wheelers, and Nyes even whisper
temptingly the base suggestion that we may profit by this war if
Britain falls and her Empire crumbles. What retribution would be
ours were we to listen to such voices! Churchill, whom no detractor
has ever called a stupid man, is not afraid to come out boldly
and declare: “I think we ought to place our trust in those moral
forces which are enshrined in the Covenant of the League of
Nations. Do not let us mock at them, for they are surely on our
side. Do not mock at them for this may well be a time when the
highest idealism is not divorced from strategic prudence. Do not
mock at them, for these may be years, strange as it may seem, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Right may walk hand in hand with Might.” This he spoke in 1937.
How the words are crammed with meaning now for America
whose vital self-interest to bring about the defeat of our enemy is
identical with the highest idealism.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Can Churchill be trusted?</em></p>

<p>A. I will answer by citing Mr. Churchill’s attitude toward Ireland.
In 1938 when the bill to turn the Irish naval bases back from British
to Irish control was being discussed, Churchill protested that
when war came, if Ireland refused to lend the ports to England,
there would be no way to get them back. Because, he said, “It will
be no use saying, ‘Then we will retake the ports.’ You will have no
right to do so. To violate Irish neutrality should it be declared at
the moment of a great war may put you out of court in the opinion
of the world and may vitiate the cause by which you may be
involved in war. If ever we have to fight again we shall be fighting
in the name of law, or respect for the rights of small countries.”
Can you imagine Hitler nourishing such scruples? Churchill has
proved, moreover, the hardest way, that he meant what he said.
The British still abstain from occupying and using the Irish ports.
They have lost scores of ships to German submarines which might
have been stopped if the Royal Navy had the use of the Irish bases.
Many people think it wrong for the British to imperil their cause
by respecting the neutrality of Ireland, which like every other
country outside the Axis owes its hopes for national independence
to a British victory.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What does Churchill think of the United States? I know that
his mother was American and that now during the war he wants as
much help from us as he can get, but what does he really think of
America?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span></p>

<p>A. We can go as far back as 1932 and find that he had this to say:
“Of course if the United States were willing to come into the
European scene as a prime factor, if they were willing to guarantee
to those countries who take their advice that they would not suffer
for it, then an incomparably wider and happier prospect would
open to the whole world. If they were willing not only to sign but
to ratify treaties of that kind, it would be an enormous advantage.
It is quite safe for the British Empire to go as far in any guarantee
in Europe as the United States is willing to go, and <em>hardly any
difficulty in the world could not be solved by the faithful cooperation
of the English speaking peoples</em>.” This was his view of the possibilities
of Anglo-American cooperation before the war; his faith
in it now is stronger than ever. As for his opinion of the American
people, one can deduce a good deal from some of the adjectives he
has used about us in the past. He has called us “active, educated,
excitable and harassed”; and “the most numerous and ebullient of
civilized communities.”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What does Churchill think of Roosevelt and the New Deal?</em></p>

<p>A. I am sure he has a profound admiration for Mr. Roosevelt quite
aside from the help he wants from him. Churchill and Roosevelt
are both aristocrats, both expert politicians, both highly cultured
men, both believers in humanity, and in the destiny of the English-speaking
peoples. There are only two factors to make them differ.
The first is that they are rivals, friendly rivals, of course, and allied
rivals for the duration of the war, but rivals just the same, and
when the time comes to translate victory into peace terms it is
going to be exciting to see which of these powerful, determined
men will do the leading. It will be a struggle of titans. As one
reviews the chief characteristics of each man it seems as though each
possesses to the ultimate possible degree the qualities of courage,
intelligence, imagination, and stubbornness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>

<p>Churchill has called Roosevelt “this great man, this thrice chosen
head of a nation of 130,000,000.” Another time in 1934 he described
Roosevelt’s administration as a dictatorship, writing:
“Although the Dictatorship is veiled by constitutional forms it is
none the less effective.” Hastily he added: “To compare Roosevelt’s
effort with that of Hitler is not to insult Roosevelt but civilization.”
Now both men have become dictators in the classical
sense of the word as it has been so sapiently defined by Frederick
L. Schuman. “‘Dictatorship’ is a form of power which is resorted
to voluntarily and temporarily by democracies to meet dangers of
invasion or revolution. It is a device to save democracy, not to
destroy it.... The disposition of democrats to regard dictatorship
in times of crisis as fatal to democracy rather than as fundamental
to its preservation reflects a tragic confusion resting upon
ignorance of history and misuse of labels.” Schuman points out
that Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini are tyrants or despots, but not, if
one uses the word properly, “dictators.”</p>

<p>The reassuring fact is that both Roosevelt and Churchill believe
that a Pax Anglo-Americana is the key to the future. Churchill
believes that the British ought to take the leading role in such an
arrangement because they have borne the heat of battle to a greater
degree than we shall have done even with our troops in Europe.
Roosevelt believes America ought to be the leader since we are
coming out of the war considerably stronger than Great Britain
and the younger nation is now ready to take over guidance of
world affairs from the parent country. Out of this fundamental
difference could come a massive dispute, but since it will have been
based on victory we can hope fervently that the opportunity for
the discussion be provided as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Churchill has a second difference with Roosevelt in the field of
economic theory and practice. He is distinctly against the New
Deal. There was a time during the period of the Blue Eagle when
Churchill seemed almost to fear that communism was coming to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the United States. He warned: “It is irrational to tear down or
cripple the capitalist system without having the fortitude of spirit
and ruthlessness of action to create a new communist system.”
With Churchillian directness he proclaims his belief in profits.
“There can never be good wages or good employment for any
length of time without good profits.”</p>

<p>With equal candor and with much wit he defends rich men. “A
second danger to President Roosevelt’s valiant and heroic experiments
seems to arise from the disposition to hunt down rich men
as if they were noxious beasts.... It is a very attractive sport,
and once it gets started quite a lot of people everywhere are found
ready to join in the chase.... The question arises whether the
general well-being of the masses of the community will be advanced
by an excessive indulgence in this amusement. The millionaire
or multi-millionaire is a highly economic animal. He sucks up
with sponge-like efficiency money from all quarters. In this process,
far from depriving ordinary people of their earnings, he
launches enterprise and carries it through, raises values, and he
expands that credit without which on a vast scale no fuller economic
life can be opened to the millions. To hunt wealth is not to
capture commonwealth.” All this, his own economic philosophy,
he sums up in the formula: “Whether it is better to have equality
at the price of poverty or well-being at the price of inequality.”</p>

<p>Does this indicate a narrowly selfish interest by Churchill in his
own class? Not at all. He believes profoundly in the possibility of
extending leisure and well-being to all mankind through the benefits
of science. He takes the evidence of Soviet Russia that the
means to general affluence is not communism, nor does he think it
can come through any form of nationalization of production. He
believes the essence of the problem is monetary. He believes the
rights of man are more important than the success of any economic
system. He believes in the British Empire as a mighty instrument
of civilization. He believes profoundly in cooperation with us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
There is no reason why the two mightiest democratic dictators,
Roosevelt and Churchill, should not emerge from the Peace Conference
with a harmonious plan.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is it true that Churchill is gifted with a peculiar power to foresee
the event?</em></p>

<p>A. I know of no statement which summed up in so few words a
complete forecast of history as was contained in one sentence of
Churchill’s delivered April 6, 1936 in a speech on the fortification
of the Rhineland. You will remember that Hitler reoccupied the
Rhineland March 6, 1936. Mr. Churchill had this to say: “The
creation of a line of forts opposite to the French frontier will
enable the German troops to be economized on that line and will
enable the main forces to swing round through Belgium and Holland.”
There in thirty-six words you have the entire story of the
Battle of France, told four years before it took place.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Tell us what you know of Mr. Churchill as a person. What are
his principal characteristics?</em></p>

<p>A. Courage is his principal characteristic. I hesitated a moment but
decided to put his courage ahead of his intelligence, because courage
is a more important quality than intelligence. I remember I
once had a spirited argument on this point with Henri Bernstein,
the French playwright. We were at the country home of Louis
Bromfield in Senlis, the point outside Paris where the Germans
during the last war came nearest to the capital. Bernstein insisted
intelligence was the most valuable quality a man could have, and
with enough of it he would not need more than a minimum of
courage. I argued that without courage the keenest intelligence is
useless in a world of action. A couple of years later Bernstein and I
were on the same refugee ship, the <em>Madura</em> of the British India<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Line, fleeing from Bordeaux to England after the fall of France.
I reminded Bernstein of our argument and insisted that the disaster
of France proved my contention was right. Surely the French
were still what they have often been called, the most intelligent
people on the continent, but for some reason which nobody has
yet completely fathomed, they had at this moment of their national
history lost the desire or the willingness to fight. I suppose it would
be fair to define that as lack of courage, although I would be the
last to assert that this is a permanent state of mind or of heart on
the part of the French.</p>

<p>The collapse of the French was the signal for Churchill to display
the finest quality of his character. Senator Gerald P. Nye
once, with the good taste characteristic of our isolationists, said:
“Britain is a dead horse. America should not team up with a lost
cause.” To France in her death agony Churchill made the offer
that she merge with Britain and establish a single Franco-British
government and cabinet, unite the resources of the French and
British Empires, and fight on to the last drop of British blood, even
if all France were occupied. It took a Churchill’s imagination,
generosity, and audacity to make such an offer. The French did
not have enough strength left to reach out and accept the hand of
rescue. We have heard a great deal about fighting to the last drop
of blood, but Churchill is the only man I have ever seen among the
belligerents who makes it absolutely convincing.</p>

<p>I was in London during those peak months of the Battle of
Britain, August and September 1940 when the Germans were
bombing by day as well as by night, trying to conquer the R.A.F.
to make invasion possible. One day I was driving through London
with Mr. Churchill, and as we passed a particularly large and well-camouflaged
machine-gun emplacement at a street intersection, the
Prime Minister called my attention to it. “Do you see that?” “Yes,”
I said, “it seems you really meant it when you said the British
would fight in the streets.” “Meant it!” exclaimed Mr. Churchill.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
“Why the Germans could if they liked drop a hundred thousand
parachutists on London, and if they did we would chew them up
and spit them out.” There was in his voice a note of delight at the
prospect. This note is present in all of Churchill’s references to
getting at the enemy. Although no man would act more quickly to
relieve his people of the necessity of shedding their blood, while
the fight is on Churchill revels in it. The responsibilities which are
his now must be greater than those carried by any other human
being on earth. One would think such a weight would have a
crushing effect upon him. Not at all. The last time I saw him, while
the Battle of Britain was still raging, he looked twenty years
younger than before the war began. As we walked across the garden
in the rear of Number Ten Downing Street I had to quicken
my pace and almost trot to keep up with him, so swiftly did he
stride along the gravel path.</p>

<p>His uplifted spirit is transmitted to the people and it is my
impression that the British are, just as Churchill said, “proud to be
under the fire of the enemy.” You may think it overdrawn but if
you had shared with them the experience of heavy air bombardment,
you would agree that Churchill was only expressing the
exact truth when he said: “The sublime but also terrible experience
and emotions of the battlefield which for centuries have been
reserved for soldiers and sailors now are shared for good or ill by
the entire population.” Even in the midst of the most fearful danger
Churchill taunts the enemy&mdash;“We are waiting for that long promised
invasion. So are the fishes.” I would not be surprised if
Churchill really wanted the Germans to try, for if they were to
try and fail it would be a defeat so disastrous that it might well
lead to a German collapse.</p>

<p>Without courage nothing can be accomplished. With it plus
intelligence everything can be done. Churchill’s courage is of every
variety. He has the simple battle courage of the Hussar. Remember
the cavalry charge at Omdurman in the Sudan when the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Lieutenant Churchill fought his way through a tangle of howling
dervishes? He has the enduring physical courage to play a championship
game of polo with a dislocated shoulder. He has the moral
courage to lead a lost cause. It was he who defended the Duke of
Windsor at the abdication, when the once most popular man in the
British Empire had lost every other friend. He has the courage to
take responsibility, and since he has been Prime Minister he has
personally taken the criticism for every ill turn of fortune, every
plan gone wrong. He can meet a hostile mob and talk it down. He
can lead in battle. He can lead in war. Above all he can infuse his
courage into others.</p>

<p>One’s pulse quickens at that immortal peroration of his delivered
on June 18, 1940, when France had surrendered, the British Expeditionary
Force had escaped with the loss of all its tools, and
England stood weaponless before the foe, in greater mortal peril
than ever in ten centuries. The words Churchill spoke then were
the equivalent of a strong army to defend the British Isles. Translated
into the deeds of the R.A.F., they defeated the enemy.
Churchill said: “What General Weygand called the Battle of
France is over. The Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon it
depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions
and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy
must very soon be turned upon us. Hitler knows that he will have
to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him,
all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward
into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole
world, including the United States and all that we have known and
cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more
sinister and perhaps more prolonged by the lights of a perverted
science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear
ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for
a thousand years, men will still say ‘This was their finest hour.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What was it Churchill said about carrying on even if the British
Isles were conquered?</em></p>

<p>A. On August 20, 1940 in the midst of the Battle of Britain,
Churchill said: “If we had been put in the terrible position of
France, a contingency now happily impossible, although, of course,
it would have been the duty of all war leaders to fight on here to
the end, it would also have been their duty, as I indicated in my
speech of June 4, to provide as far as possible for the Naval security
of Canada and our Dominions and to make sure they had the
means to carry on the struggle from beyond the oceans.”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>That would be fine for us if we could depend upon it, but do
you think Churchill really meant it? What good would it do for
the British Navy to carry on if the British Isles were conquered?</em></p>

<p>A. I am sure that Churchill himself would do exactly as he said
he would. He would perish with his troops or with his Navy&mdash;who
can tell how or where&mdash;but he would never surrender. Can
you doubt it when you hear those words of his which are as much
an inspiration for us today as they were for the British when he
uttered them on the last day of the evacuation of Dunkirk? They
deserve to be memorized by us all. “Even though large tracts of
Europe and many old and famous states have fallen or may fall into
the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule,
we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in
France, we shall fight on the seas, and oceans, we shall fight with
growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall
defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the
beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the
fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never
surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this
island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our
Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the new
world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and
the liberation of the old.”</p>

<p>With Churchill’s picture these words are placarded in homes and
offices throughout the British Empire. Their spirit is the spirit of
Britain. But having said this I am compelled to add that it would
be feeble-minded for us to expect that the British Navy would
continue resistance to the Germans after the British Isles had been
conquered.</p>

<p>Let us examine what the position would be if the British Isles
fell. First let us ask a British Naval Officer what would happen to
the Royal Navy if the British Isles were conquered. He will tell
you: “There wouldn’t be any Navy left.” I can see readily how
this would be true. If the Germans try invasion, the Royal Navy
is going to throw itself between the home island and the invaders
with a desperation such as has never been equaled in British Naval
history, and that is saying a very great deal. The Germans cannot
capture the British Isles by air power alone. They can land men
and machine guns by air as they did at Crete, but the heavy
weapons they need to beat off and batter down the formidable
British artillery and heavy tanks now massed at home, they will
have to land by sea. Without these weapons they cannot win. The
Royal Navy will prevent their landing or perish in the attempt.
The Germans will try to clear the way for their invading craft
by torpedoes, mines, speedboats, Stukas, burning oil on the water,
and every conceivable means, and by some perhaps not now conceivable
to us. The British defenders will discard caution and risk
everything. They will hurl themselves at the invader. If they lose
there will surely be little left of the Navy.</p>

<p>But suppose there were left a British naval force large enough
when taken in combination with what we could spare from the
Pacific to continue to maintain practical control of the Atlantic,
enough anyway to prevent any German attempt at sending an invading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
army to America. Could we then expect this remnant of
the British Navy to retire to Canada or the United States, and continue
resistance to the Germans? I do not think so.</p>

<p>In the first place, what would be the purpose of the British Navy
in continuing resistance to the Germans after the British Isles had
been captured? Would it be for the purpose of eventually reconquering
the British Isles? No, because that would be impossible.
This is one of those grim facts which are too ugly for most people
to look at, but there is no use turning our eyes away and refusing
to see that if the Germans do invade and conquer the British Isles,
the British people will have finished their life. It would be the end
for them, not for the duration of this war, which would in fact be
ended then, but for as far into the future as the imagination can
travel. The Germans might remain in possession of the British Isles
or in effective control for the thousand years Hitler so often boasts
about, or until they became weak through centuries of good living.
Hitler would disarm the people of Britain and allow hunger
to decimate them. He could count on forty per cent of the population
dying of starvation in a year or so. Does this seem an exaggeration?
It is only one more of those facts about Hitler which
nobody would believe. The trusting Dutch would not believe
what Hitler was like until he taught the people of Rotterdam. But
the British people have now learned their lesson. They have totally
lost the wide-eyed faith of our Lindberghs, that Hitler is “human
after all.” The British know Hitler would do just what I have said,
he would deliberately destroy a great part of the population, allowing
to remain alive only those sufficiently broken to become good
slaves. But why, you ask, could not the British Navy reconquer
the British Isles, if they had our wholehearted help? The answer
is that there would be no base from which to operate.</p>

<p>We can now contemplate reconquering Europe from the Nazis
because we have a base or several possible bases from which to
operate against the Reich. We have the British Isles and Russia and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the Middle East, and parts of North Africa, and may have other
bases before the war is over. But if the British Isles were captured,
where could the British Navy land to invade and repossess them?
And with what troops would this engagement be fought? With
the Canadians and Australians? Nobody would dare disparage the
fighting qualities of these magnificent men, but if the 46,000,000
Britishers in the British Isles had failed to throw back the German
Army is it likely that 16,000,000 Canadians and Australians could
defeat it? What about the United States? If we had not entered
the war before the conquest of the British Isles, is it likely we
would go to war after the British had been beaten? Moreover, if
we did, it is inconceivable that we should beat the Germans after
they had seized the resources of the United Kingdom. They would
then have added to the shipbuilding capacity of the continent all
the British shipyards, at this moment the most productive in the
world. It might be worth our while to glance an instant at the
shipbuilding situation which would exist if Germany takes the
British Isles.</p>

<p>The shipbuilding capacity of each of the following countries is
listed as of the most productive year since 1917. This was usually
1919.</p>

<p>After the defeat of Britain, Germany and her allies would possess
the capacity to build 4,335,000 tons of ships a year, which is more
than four times our 1941 production of around 1,000,000 tons and
is even larger than our record performance in 1919 when we
turned out 4,075,000 tons of ships. Admiral Land’s prediction that
we would eventually build 6,000,000 tons a year remains to be
fulfilled. As matters now stand if the Germans were to capture
Britain, time would be on their side for the building of ships.
Furthermore, of course, the Germans would inherit the vast British
industrial machine, and save for the production of steel, would
have the power to turn out more airplanes and munitions than we
could for many years. All of this is merely to emphasize what the
fall of Britain and the end of the British Navy as a fighting force
against Hitler would mean to the United States.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But isn’t Churchill often wrong in his military judgment?
Hasn’t he made mistakes due to overconfidence?</em></p>

<p>A. It is true that Mr. Churchill has the vices of his virtues, and
since his most prominent virtue is courage, he also possesses what
has seemed at times to be recklessness. His sanguine temperament
makes him ideally equipped to lead a nation in desperate circumstances,
but his critics of whom a few still exist will never cease insisting
on the obvious, that he makes mistakes, as though it were
not the hoariest of adages that only the man who never does anything
commits no errors. They list a roll of his alleged military
failures, beginning with his unsuccessful defense of Antwerp and
the costly attempt to take the Dardanelles in the last war; and in
this war Norway, Greece, and Crete. But if these events are analyzed
it will be seen that each of them had its justification.</p>

<p>Many military critics looking back at the last war now agree
that Mr. Churchill was right to advocate holding Antwerp as an
Allied strong point behind the German lines, and if the Allied High<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
Command had supported him sufficiently Churchill’s defense
might have succeeded. The Dardanelles attempt&mdash;which used to be
the failure his enemies most enjoyed&mdash;was in the view of most
military men today a brilliant conception which would have ended
the war victoriously for the Allies two years earlier, if Churchill’s
plan had been carried out as it could have been. We know now not
only that the campaign could have succeeded from the outset and
at comparatively little cost, if the Churchill timetable had been
scrupulously kept, but also that the straits could have been captured
even at the very end if one last push had been made. One of
Raymond Swing’s best stories is of his experience as a war correspondent
with the Turks, whom he saw hoarding their last few
rounds of ammunition as, to their astonishment, the British steamed
away, losing with a completely un-British lack of persistence. It
was jealousy more than anything else that spoiled the Dardanelles
campaign, Kitchener’s jealousy of Churchill.</p>

<p>In his old age, Kitchener, the Army chief, obstinately refused
to do what the Navy chief advised, and the end was failure. It was
perhaps the most keenly felt failure in the life of Churchill when he
resigned after the Dardanelles. Anyone who reads the painstaking
account he has written of the campaign in his history of the war,
<cite>The World Crisis</cite>, may perceive how heavy the blow was. Even
clearer evidence are the pictures of him in his country place at
Chartwell. One for which he sat immediately after the Dardanelles
campaign shows him looking years older than a picture of him
before the campaign began. No, the Dardanelles ought to be remembered
to Churchill’s credit, and it will be eventually.</p>

<p>In this war its place has been given by his critics to Norway,
Crete, and Greece. Ed Angly, my companion in flight from
France, used humorously to wonder if the British were ever going
to cease retreating and my reply was that they probably never
would until they had retreated to victory. The Norwegian campaign
discouraged many, and critics on both sides of the Atlantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
demanded to know why the British secret service had not known in
advance of the German intention to invade Norway; why the
Royal Navy had not prevented invasion; why the British Army
landed in the north could not hold on.</p>

<p>The reproach of faulty information can be leveled only by persons
not acquainted with the nature of the Gestapo. It must not
have escaped general attention that when the German Army
marches into a captured territory, for a few days news of a sort
continues to trickle out, and we may hope that British or other
enemy agents continue to function during this time. But as
soon as the Gestapo appears, with Himmler directing its hordes of
agents in civilian clothes, and its tens of thousands of black-uniformed
SS, it is as though an asbestos curtain had fallen on the
frontiers of the country, and from then on the silence of the grave
envelops the land. I was not surprised that Hitler could strike with
such devastating secrecy; what victim of his has been warned except
by the general reputation of the invader? Even the Bolsheviks
were plaintively surprised when the “assassin of the working
classes” so violently dissolved his friendship with the “scum of
the earth.” We may be sure that if Hitler were ever put, by the
fall of Britain, in a position to attack the Western Hemisphere, we
would also be surprised, not by the action but by the time and
method. The Norwegian surprise was no fault of Churchill.</p>

<p>The question why the British could not hold on is one that is
put not only about Norway but about Crete and Greece and it may
be put again before the last battle is fought. The answer is one
which may have to be borne in mind for a long time. It is contained
in the simplest facts about the war, which tend to be forgotten in
the riot of daily news. The principal fact is that Britain after two
years of war has not yet caught up with the numbers and equipment
of the German war machine built by a population double
that of the British over seven years of peacetime preparation and
two of war. The British have fought on nearly every one of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
battlefields so far with inferior numbers against superior material
and better-trained men. Let those of us in America who imagine
we have only to call a few million boys to the colors and train
them a year in order to have an army, consider the British experience.
The British soldiers are only now after more than two years
of war training, becoming a capable modern army, about one-third
the size of Britain’s “medium-sized” army.</p>

<p>Finally we heard the criticism that Churchill’s decision to send
troops to Greece was a mistake, since he knew they could not hold
out against the Germans. “Political” reasons, it was said, ought not
to govern military decisions. But what is the war being fought
about if not to re-establish honor among nations? Britain was sworn
to come to the aid of Greece. Had she failed to do so, forlorn
though the hope was of immediate success, she would have lost a
good part of that moral reputation which is worth more than many
army corps to her today. This “political” decision was made in the
sense of the classical definition of politics, “that branch of ethics
dealing with the ethical relations and duties of states.”</p>

<p>Churchill did make one public mistake, and it was shared by
hopeful millions, when he said at the beginning of the Norwegian
campaign, “Herr Hitler has committed a grave strategic error in
spreading the war so far to the north.” The man who had almost
never underestimated the Germans did so that time.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Wasn’t that apparent error in judgment perhaps really a piece
of good-cheer propaganda for the people?</em></p>

<p>A. I do not think so; it was a real mistake based on his own audacity,
yet who would not prefer a leadership which tries and fails
to one which does not try at all? In Churchill the British have one
leader who understands that wars are never won on the defensive,
and we may be sure that he can be depended upon to seize the first
conceivable opportunity to carry the war into Hitler’s territory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
The offensive spirit never had a more consistent exponent than
Churchill, as in his proclamation:</p>

<p>“We are resolved to destroy Hitler and every vestige of his Nazi
regime; from this nothing will turn us&mdash;nothing. We will never
parley, we will never negotiate with Hitler or any of his men. We
shall fight him by land, we shall fight him by sea, we shall fight him
in the air, until, with God’s help, we have rid the earth of his
shadow and liberated his peoples from the yoke.”</p>

<p>This eloquence of Churchill is a gift from Heaven for our side
during these terrible years, when confusion of mind is the greatest
foe of the democracies. One of the most famous sayings of Hitler,
quoted by Rauschning is: “Mental confusion, contradiction of feeling,
indecisiveness, panic; these are our weapons.”</p>

<p>We in America can see how effective these weapons are. Consider
the mental confusion, indecisiveness, and conflicting feelings
aroused in the United States by the speeches of Hitler’s American
Quislings, the Lindberghs and Wheelers. The counterpart of these
circles existed in England but they were long ago rendered powerless
and even speechless by the analytical eloquence of Churchill.
Take the case of Hitler’s invasion of Russia. Hitler undoubtedly
expected to divide the outside world by proclaiming his “Holy
Crusade” against Bolshevism. But Churchill choked this deceit in
its inception. The Germans began their attack on Russia at four
o’clock in the morning, and before the day was out Churchill had
given the world his answer. Other statesmen might have waited a
day or even a week. Churchill gave Hitler no time to spread
mental confusion. “Any man or state,” Churchill declared, “who
fights against Nazidom will have our aid. Any man or state who
marches with Hitler is our foe.... Hitler’s invasion of Russia is
no more than a prelude to an attempted invasion of the British
Isles.... The Russian danger is therefore our danger and the
danger of the United States.... Let us redouble our exertions
and strike with united strength while life and power remain.” This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
declaration, swift and uncompromising as a bullet, was equivalent
to the loss of a great battle for Hitler. I am sure he entertained
hopes that he could induce Britain even to stop fighting in order
that he could more easily destroy Bolshevik Russia. Churchill’s
speed prevented the question from even being debated. This is the
finest example of leadership. The Prime Minister did not wait to
find out by Gallup poll or otherwise what the British people
thought. He boldly led them.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do you think the flight of Hess to England had any connection
with the German attack on Russia which followed six weeks later?</em></p>

<p>A. Hess fled to England May 10, and Hitler attacked Russia June
21. I think there must have been a connection, and I have my theory
of it, but it is only a theory. I think Hess may have carried Churchill
a message from Hitler saying he was going to attack Russia, offering
a negotiated peace, and soliciting the benevolent neutrality if
not the active aid of Britain to destroy the Bolshevik menace. We
may be sure that whatever was the purpose of Hess’s visit,
Churchill knows all about it by now.</p>

<p>There are two passages in Churchill’s speech after the invasion
of Russia which might bear on Hess. In one place he says, “All this
was no surprise to me. I gave clear and precise warnings to Stalin
of what was coming.” And then, as though he realized that this
statement might indicate that he had specific foreknowledge of the
German plans against Russia, Churchill adds, “I gave him warnings
as I have given warnings to others before. I can only hope that
these warnings did not fall unheeded.” Then at another point
Churchill emphasized: “We will never parley, we will never negotiate
with Hitler or any of his men.” That might refer to Hess’s
effort to negotiate. We know that if Hess had carried such a proposal
to Churchill it would have been rejected, and if Churchill
warned Stalin it is very likely Stalin profited by the warning. It has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
been argued, however, that the British could have allowed Hess to
believe, and to transmit to Hitler his belief, that the proposal would
be accepted. This would have served to encourage Hitler to go
ahead with his plans and attack Russia. We can be certain that
in the meeting between Hess and Churchill, the Prime Minister
did not come off second best.</p>

<p>I knew Hess personally&mdash;not very well, but well enough to have
formed an estimate of his character. On the basis of his character
I would say we could exclude a great many alleged explanations of
his flight. He was brave and led a life of hazardous adventure. He
was not likely to flee for cowardly reasons. He was first in the personal
esteem of Hitler and Hitler was the only person who could
have threatened his life. Himmler could not do so, nor Goering.
He was a quiet, unambitious fellow and had few enemies. I do not
believe fear had anything to do with the flight. He was devoted to
Hitler and it is almost inconceivable that he should have done anything
contrary to the Fuehrer’s wishes. He was never a policy
maker, meddled not at all in the high politics of the party or state,
but merely delivered speeches on order, and acted as a sort of super-private
secretary and valet to his master. It is not likely that he went
to England to advance a policy of his own, as was widely believed
before the German attack on Russia. Many signs point to the
probability that Hess was acting as Hitler’s emissary to try to dupe
Churchill into withdrawing from the war and sanctioning the
attack on Russia. The objections are, of course, that it is hard to
believe that Hitler could have been such a fool as to think such an
attempt feasible, or that he would risk losing his valued confederate
on a mission with such little likelihood of success, or that he would
have risked the revelation of his plans to the Russians. Yet if Hess
had fled because he was afraid, or because he thought Germany
was losing, or because he had split with Hitler, or for any other
reason discreditable to the Nazi cause, surely the British by now
would have given the facts to the public. It would have made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
best propaganda in the world. I heard Jan Valtin, author of <cite>Out of
the Night</cite>, advance the suggestion that Hess, who was always a
sensitive fellow, with a touch of sissy in his carriage, and who was
attached to the Fuehrer with an almost morbid devotion, might
have succumbed to a fit of pique; he might have been slighted by
Hitler before one of his rivals, as Goering or Himmler or Goebbels
or Rosenberg, and might have leaped into his plane and left the
country to “make Hitler sorry.” This is an engaging theory. I will
stick to mine.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What is the secret of Churchill’s success?</em></p>

<p>A. His appetite for creation. He is as eager to create as Hitler is
to destroy life. He cannot live without creating. Hitler cannot live
without destroying. Churchill’s courage, wit, and eloquence are
matched by his industry. He does an incredible amount of work.
Before he came back into the government he never let a day go by
without writing at least 2,000 or 3,000 words. His powers of concentration
are phenomenal. His memory is prodigious. He dictates
everything he writes. I have visited him in his workroom on the
top floor of his country home at Chartwell in Kent. A shelf about
breast-high runs the length of the room, and on it he has arranged
his books of reference, notes, and documents. I was there when
he was finishing his monumental life of his ancestor, the Duke of
Marlborough. There were twenty or thirty volumes lying open on
the shelf, with paper slips marking other passages to be consulted.
His practice is to walk up and down the room, glancing here and
there at his various works of reference, dictating all the time to a
secretary. As in the composition of his speeches, he has a first draft
typed with plenty of space for corrections and interlining. This is
returned for recopying and sometimes half a dozen drafts are necessary
before the final form is completed. The result of this striving
after perfection is something as near approaching perfection as one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
can find in the works of any writer of, what I might call, inspired
history. I remember once a conversation about Churchill’s writing
ability with Alexander Woollcott. I thought I had been as appreciative
as one could be, but Aleck broke in: “No, Knick, you haven’t
said enough. Churchill is the greatest master of the English language
since the men who wrote the King James version of the Bible.”
There is a nobility and grandeur about Churchill’s oratory which
no literature I know outside the Bible can approach. On July 14,
1940 when Hitler’s army had swept all before it save the British
Isles, Churchill said: “And now it has come to us to stand alone in
the breach, and face the worst that the tyrant’s might and enmity
can do. Bearing ourselves humbly before God, but conscious that
we serve an unfolding purpose, we are ready to defend our native
land against the invasion by which it is threatened. We are fighting
<em>by</em> ourselves alone; but we are not fighting <em>for</em> ourselves alone.
Here in this strong City of Refuge which enshrines the title deeds
of human progress and is of deep consequence to Christian civilization;
here, girt about by the seas and oceans where the Navy reigns;
shielded from above by the prowess and devotion of our airmen&mdash;we
await undismayed the impending assault. Perhaps it will come
tonight. Perhaps it will come next week. Perhaps it will never come.
We must show ourselves equally capable of meeting sudden violent
shock, or what is perhaps a harder test, a prolonged vigil. But be
the ordeal sharp or long, or both, we shall seek no terms, we shall
tolerate no parley; we may show mercy&mdash;we shall ask for none.”</p>

<p>Can this language be matched except by the adjurations of the
prophets of old? And what could surpass the fiery blast of his invective
turned upon Hitler? “This wicked man,” he said, “the
repository and embodiment of many forms of soul-destroying
hatred, this monstrous product of former wrongs and shame, has
now resolved to try to break our famous island race by a process
of indiscriminate slaughter and destruction. What he has done is
to kindle a fire in British hearts, here and all over the world, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
will glow long after all traces of the conflagration he has caused
in London have been removed. He has lighted a fire which will
burn with a steady and consuming flame until the last vestiges of
Nazi tyranny have been burnt out of Europe and until the Old
World&mdash;and the New&mdash;can join hands to rebuild the temples of
man’s freedom and man’s honor, upon foundations which will not
soon or easily be overthrown.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to catalogue the various words Churchill has used
to describe Hitler, and to note that he prefers the simplest descriptives,
“wicked,” “evil,” and “bad.” What other speaker could use
the childish adjective “bad” and make it so effective as did Churchill
on April 27, 1941 when he said: “In February, as you may remember,
<em>that bad man</em> in one of his raving outbursts threatened us
with a terrifying increase in numbers and activities of his U-boats....”
And again on February 9: “We must all of us have been asking
ourselves what is <em>that wicked man</em> whose crime-stained regime
and system are at bay and in the toils, what has he been preparing
during these winter months?” And earlier on October 1, 1939:
“How soon victory will be gained depends upon how long Herr
Hitler and his group of <em>wicked men</em>, whose hands are stained with
blood and soiled with corruption, can keep their grip upon the
docile, unhappy German people.” Once he calls him a “cornered
maniac,” and in the same speech of November 12, 1939 says: “I
have the sensation and also the conviction that <em>that evil man</em> over
there and his cluster of confederates are not sure of themselves as
we are sure of ourselves; that they are harassed in their guilty souls
by the thought and by the fear of an ever approaching retribution
for their crimes, and for the orgy of destruction into which they
have plunged us all....” On March 30, 1940 he refers to “Hitler’s
murderous rage,” and says, “In his frenzy, this <em>wicked man</em> and the
criminal regime which he has conceived and erected, increasingly
turn their malice upon the weak.”</p>

<p>Constantly recurs the simile of bloodstained, foul hands, perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
best in Churchill’s speech of June 12, 1941 when he said: “We can
not yet see how deliverance will come or when it will come, but
nothing is more certain than that every trace of Hitler’s footsteps,
every stain of his infected and corroding fingers will be sponged
and purged and if need be, blasted from the surface of the earth.”</p>

<p>The most famous of Churchill’s epigrams is the one now known
by the entire English-speaking world, about the Royal Air Force,
delivered in his speech of August 20, 1940 on “The War Situation”
in the House of Commons. I heard that speech and particularly
noted the epigram, but I cannot now certify which of the two
current versions he actually delivered. As I remember, he said,
“Never in the field of human conflict have so many owed so much
to so few.” But in the collected volume of his speeches edited by
his son, Randolph, the sentence runs, “Never in the field of human
conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.” I have
seen both of these versions on placards in British stores and offices.
Hansard must have the original version and it is possible Churchill
or his son may have made an amendment in the volume of speeches.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What are Churchill’s principal interests?</em></p>

<p>A. I am going to make an omnibus answer to this and include replies
to a score of questions usually asked about Mr. Churchill.
Roughly, in order of importance Mr. Churchill’s principal interests
are England; the war, the Royal Navy; his family, past,
present, and future; power; politics; the English language; public
speaking; writing history and making it; writing journalism; reading
history, biography, literature; the English-speaking people;
Scotch whisky; good food, good wines, cigars; the French people;
all other people; conversation; favorable publicity; unfavorable
publicity; ceremony; painting; bricklaying; swimming (in younger
days polo); six-pack bezique; his hats; his shoes; his clothes; and of
course “that bloodthirsty guttersnipe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>

<p>Compare this with Hitler’s interests: power; Hitler-Germany;
the war; the German Army; barbarism; haranguing crowds in public;
haranguing friends in private; propaganda; rewriting history;
reading military history (and making it); suppressing journalism;
the Jews; colossal architecture; the movies; vegetarian food; and of
course “the warmonger Churchill.”</p>

<p>By this comparison I do not put the two men on the same level,
for morally they cannot be considered as belonging to the same
species, but it is interesting to note the contrasts that come out in
such a list. It is not merely the contrast between the aristocrat who
is striving to preserve free life for common men and the “guttersnipe”
who is bent upon enslaving them all; it is a contrast of two
worlds.</p>

<p>Churchill has a profound historical sense and the thought of himself
as a part of the broad stream of the British people, flowing
from the distant past into the limitless future, is never absent from
his speaking and writing. He is never just Churchill, he is Churchill
of British history, of the Marlboroughs, but now more than ever
Churchill of the British people, with whom he has established a
community of feeling seldom equaled in the relationship of leader
to people. It has always been Hitler’s boast that “I <em>am</em> Germany!”
An Italian journalist thinking to jibe at England during the tormented
months of the Blitz said mockingly that the British Isles
seemed to be inhabited by “forty million Churchills.” He was
right, for under Churchill’s leadership the entire population has
become animated with his courage and he <em>is</em> England to the same
degree and by the same psychological process as Hitler <em>is</em> Germany.
Hitler obtained his ascendancy over the German people by expressing
their hitherto largely unconscious aspirations, for revenge,
aggression, expansion, and conquest. At the height of the British
people’s peril they turned spontaneously and unanimously to
Churchill whom Providence seemed to have reserved for this critical
hour, and they entrusted to him the fulfillment of their aspirations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
to beat off the enemy, save their families, and win victory. I
was there and for four months watched the British people and in
particular the eight million Londoners endure the anxiety of expected
invasion and the full blast of the greatest attack ever made
on a civilian population in history and I know that their faith in
Churchill was a most important factor in their endurance. Every
Londoner thought as the bombs fell, “Churchill is there; he can’t
be beaten; we can’t be beaten.” Churchill “became” England. This
is the experience that has elevated him above himself, fulfilled his
character, made him great. Today Churchill’s every faculty of
soul, mind, and body is devoted to the service of the British Commonwealth.
Today every soul and resource in the German Commonwealth
is devoted to the service of Hitler.</p>

<p>Churchill actively directs the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force
but his love is the Navy. One can tell from his speeches how frequently
his mind dwells upon it. It remains his favorite branch of
the services, despite the noble tribute he has paid the R.A.F. He
reserves for it words such as he would use otherwise only to describe
Old England herself. “Amphibious” is the term he likes best
to define the power of Britain in arms. His conviction of the paramount
importance of the Fleet was thus dramatically expressed:
“On them, as we conceived, floated the might, majesty, dominion
and power of the British Empire. All our long history built up
century after century, all our great affairs in every part of the
globe, all the means of livelihood and safety of our faithful, industrious,
active population depended upon them. Open the seacocks
and let them sink beneath the surface and in a few minutes,
half an hour at the most&mdash;the whole outlook of the world would
be changed. The British Empire would dissolve like a dream; each
isolated community struggling forward by itself; the central power
of union broken; mighty provinces, whole Empires in themselves,
drifting helplessly out of control, and falling a prey to strangers;
and Europe after one sudden convulsion passing into the iron grip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
and rule of the Teuton and of all that the Teutonic system meant.
There would only be left far off across the Atlantic, unarmed, unready
and as yet uninstructed America, to maintain single-handed
law and freedom among men.” That was written about the Royal
Navy mobilized for war in August 1914 but with what melancholy
accuracy it reflects the situation of today, except that this time the
Teutonic might is such that Europe has already had its one sudden
convulsion and has passed under the rule of a Teutonic system far
grimmer than anything the Hohenzollerns would have imposed.
And once again, after a score of years of warning, America still
finds herself “unarmed, unready and as yet uninstructed,” dependent
now for her very life upon the continued existence of that
Navy which Churchill apostrophizes.</p>

<p>Now of course the war takes all of Churchill’s time, but in normal
circumstances he has an enormous number of interests and activities.
He concentrates fiercely upon each in turn, and everything
he does he does at least well, some things he does excellently, and
some he does superlatively. Fighting, speaking, writing, eating,
drinking, sleeping, smoking, all are the source of intense satisfaction.
He relishes every moment in his life. This war was made for
him, because fighting is life itself to Churchill. In the last war he
was a subordinate and could not thoroughly enjoy the fight when
others checked his combat plans. Now he is unchecked by anybody
except the British people, and they have shown they are only too
glad to let him savor to the full what are to him the joys of responsibility
in the greatest fight with the greatest consequences in
the memory of mankind. Before the war the most exciting form of
conflict was politics, about which Churchill once said, “Politics are
almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous.” He takes the
keenest pleasure in writing, but he would always give up his work
on a book to go back into politics, as he did when this war began.</p>

<p>He was just finishing his monumental <cite>History of the English
Speaking Peoples</cite> when he was called to the Admiralty. I understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
the <cite>History</cite> is to be in several volumes, but despite its size
Churchill wrote the whole thing in a year, dictating thousands of
words a day. He had worked on it, gathering material for many
years, and such is the organization of his mind and so precise and
comprehensive is his memory than when he once began he was
able to dictate it almost as fast as he could talk. I have heard that
the publisher has already set the book up but is waiting presumably
for the end of the war to release it.</p>

<p>Today his prewar books, as <cite>My Early Days</cite>, are reprinted and
have become best sellers. Even his prewar newspaper articles are
eagerly dragged out, and reprinted both here and in England to sell
at high prices. His books have been phenomenally successful and
his income from them, from journalism, and from lectures has been
for most of his life considerably higher than the $50,000 a year
he receives as Prime Minister. It was always a financial sacrifice
for him to go into office despite the comparatively liberal salaries
of British ministers. He has no interest in money. His earnings have
been large ever since he was a war correspondent in South Africa,
but he has spent money as fast as it came, on his estate, his family,
and on good living. One of his best American friends, Bernard
Baruch, once tried to instruct him in the art of stock exchange
speculation but nothing came of it. Churchill had for it the interest
he has for everything in life, and wanted to learn it, but he lacked
the indispensable requirement for amassing a fortune, namely an
overwhelming desire to make money. The power given by the
possession of money is so paltry compared with political power
that none of the great statesmen, or even the wicked dictators, have
exhibited any interest in it. What use has Hitler for money? I
doubt that he has touched any for years.</p>

<p>Until this war began it was power that appealed to Churchill
more than anything else in the world. It is ironical that now he
possesses it to a greater degree than he could ever have dreamed of,
power for its own sake he no longer wants. But that has not lessened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
his aesthetic capacity to enjoy it. No stress of war, nor the imminence
of awful danger, can prevent him from enjoying the
power of his spoken or written word. You can feel his artistic
satisfaction as you hear him in the House of Commons, delivering
on a desperate day passages calculated not only to encourage,
guide, and inspire, but to excite admiration for their felicity.</p>

<p>We American correspondents in London used regularly to attend
the House every time Churchill spoke, although none of us need
have done so, since the speeches were delivered into our offices almost
instantaneously by ticker. We wanted to hear him in person
not only for the stirring drama of it but because as journalists we
wished to listen to the greatest living master of our craft. The
trouble of attending Parliament was considerable, for the old
House, now in ruins, was too small to accommodate even the Members
if they all attended, and the foreign press was allotted so few
seats it was necessary to apply days in advance to get a place. The
narrow seats with too little space for knees and feet were uncomfortable,
the acoustics poor, but the view from our gallery was perfect.</p>

<p>There sits the government, the bald head of Mr. Churchill shining
among the Members with unmistakable authority. The benches
are nearly empty until the time draws near for the Prime Minister
to speak; a few minutes before he rises the House is jammed with
Members sitting even on the foot of the Speaker’s dais. The Prime
Minister rises. There is dead silence as Mr. Churchill lays before
him a sheaf of what are technically called notes, as it is prohibited
in the House for any member, even the Prime Minister, to read a
speech. This rule is presumably to prevent a member from using a
speech written by someone else. The familiar Washington ghost
writers would have little employment in Westminster. Mr. Churchill
would have about as much use for one as Shakespeare would
have had. Mr. Churchill’s “notes” are in fact his completely written
speech which he has memorized by rereading the final copy quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
on the way to the House. He has worked on this speech for several
hours a day for eight days, writing, rewriting, until he finally has
it typed on sheets half the size of standard typewriter paper.
Thereafter he never looks at it. He has it before him, and he automatically
turns the pages, but his delivery is perfectly extemporaneous,
and you would imagine as you sat there watching and listening
that those incomparable phrases were conceived at the moment,
and to the satisfaction of hearing them is added the illusion of being
present at their creation. Mr. Churchill himself insists he cannot
speak well impromptu and I have heard that his son Randolph,
recently seated in Parliament, is considered a better offhand speaker
than his father.</p>

<p>It is an extraordinary coincidence that this greatest orator of
modern times should have an impediment of speech similar, we may
imagine, to that of the greatest orator of ancient times, Demosthenes.
Churchill has almost overcome the impediment. His delivery
is not what we would consider the best. He depends not at all on
gesture. Now and then he pauses to glance over the top of his
spectacles with defiance or curiosity. His stance is determined, not
graceful. For the most part he stands quietly in the same spot, and
only moves a step backward or forward when he wishes to emphasize
a passage. His voice is sonorous, strong, not the golden
voice of a William Jennings Bryan, but also not the vulgar guttural
of Hitler. Yet when Churchill speaks of Hitler there comes into
his tone a note that promises to meet all the Nazi’s brutality and
pay interest. Churchill’s voice is ideally adapted to the radio and
the millions of Americans who listen to him on the air have heard
him at his best. Many have exclaimed at his accent that he does
not talk like an Englishman. His is the accent of Sandhurst, Britain’s
West Point, which is nearer the American way of speaking
than the curious upper-class cockney affected by some graduates
of Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<p>I do not know why Mr. Churchill avoids as much as possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
making extemporaneous speeches, unless it is his passion for perfection,
because as a conversationalist he is without superior and he
has few peers. One of them was his intimate friend, Lord Birkenhead,
whose power of expression was almost on a par with Churchill’s,
as I had the opportunity to observe once in Berlin when the
then most brilliant lawyer in England attended a luncheon of the
Anglo-American Press Association and dazzled us with his talk. I
remember the answer he gave when someone asked what he thought
of Mussolini. “Mussolini,” he remarked, “bestrides Italy like a
Colossus, but to judge a rider one must consider the kind of horse
he rides.”</p>

<p>I have listened to Mr. Churchill talk at the dinner table and he is
as brilliant there as he is in the House of Commons. His conversational
style has the same classical quality of his writing and public
speaking. Every sentence is rounded and balanced; none is left incomplete,
and I should think that ninety-five per cent of everything
he says in talking with his friends could be taken down by a
stenographer and reproduced without changing a syllable. At the
same time there is no studied effect and the listeners have not the
feeling they are attending a recitation or declamation. They are
transported back to the time when, either in Ancient Greece or in
eighteenth century Europe, men cultivated the art of speaking and
especially of conversation. Who knows what effect it will have
upon English education and English habits of conversation to have
had as a Prime Minister during the war a master of the word such
as appears only seldom in centuries. The oratory of Churchill must
already have influenced the language standards of the English-speaking
world, even though imperceptibly, for it is impossible that
so many millions should have listened to him and read his speeches
without having their taste improved. As a contrast it is interesting
to observe what the effect has already been upon the German language
to have had the apostle of illiteracy as the head of the German
Reich for eight years; the language of Goethe and Heine has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
been supplanted deliberately by a coarse vulgarization of German
chosen for its appeal to the lowest instincts of the population.</p>

<p>Churchill attracted much attention when in a memorandum to
all government offices he asked for a more effective and economic
use of the English language in official communications and demanded
the abandonment of the jargon currently in use by bureaucrats.
He can be colloquial. The first time I met Mr. Churchill was
at a luncheon given by Lady Colefax, who has done more to help
American correspondents in London than almost anyone there.
Present were Mr. Churchill, J. L. Garvin, the crusty, brilliant editor
of the <cite>Observer</cite> and one-time editor of the <cite>Encyclopaedia Brittanica</cite>,
Somerset Maugham, Mrs. Simpson, not yet the wife of Edward,
Harold Nicolson, Peter Fleming, Jan Masaryk, and a number
of others. The conversation was almost exclusively between
Churchill and Garvin, and well it might be, for Garvin is one of
the few who can talk on anything like equal terms with the master,
and indeed on this occasion Garvin practically talked Churchill
silent. It was just two years before the war, but the topic was even
then the position of Russia, and Garvin exclaimed, “Do you mean
to say you would throw in your lot with the Bolsheviks?” The
Churchillian reply was, “I mean just that, old cock!” with a remark
to the effect that when one had to face an enemy like Germany it
would be only common sense to try for the help of any ally no
matter how distasteful otherwise.</p>

<p>We can see from Churchill’s policy of helping Russia since the
German attack how consistent he has remained. On the day after
the Russians marched into Poland&mdash;and horrified the world of fellow
travelers and caused all except party-liners and a few foresighted
realists to draw back in aversion from this manifestation of
Red Imperialism&mdash;I had a talk with Mr. Churchill, who had been
appointed First Lord of the Admiralty a fortnight before. I asked
him whether, since Great Britain had guaranteed the territory of
Poland against aggression and had gone to war with Germany because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of the German attack on Poland, one could now consider
that Great Britain was at war with Russia since the Russians also
had attacked Poland? I am not at liberty to quote him, but he gave
the answer in public a fortnight later when after the fall of Warsaw
he declared: “We could have wished that the Russian Armies
should be standing on their present line as the friends and allies of
Poland instead of as invaders. <em>But that the Russian armies should
stand on this line was clearly necessary for the safety of Russia
against the Nazi menace....</em> I can not forecast to you the action
of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma: but
perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.”</p>

<p>Thus early and late Churchill maintained that it was desirable to
attempt to bring Russia into arms as an ally against the Germans,
and he was one of the few men in Britain who could advocate
such a policy without being suspected of sympathizing with the
Bolsheviks. Only Finland shook his resolution to do nothing to
alienate the Russians and it is interesting now to recall his words
uttered in the midst of the Russian assault on Finland: “Only Finland,
superb, nay, sublime in the jaws of peril&mdash;Finland shows
what free men can do. The service rendered by Finland to mankind
is magnificent. They have exposed for all the world to see, the
military incapacity of the Red Army and of the Red Air Force.
Many illusions about Soviet Russia have been dispelled in these few
fierce weeks of fighting in the Arctic Circle. Everyone can see how
Communism rots the soul of a nation; how it makes it abject and
hungry in peace and proves it base and abominable in war.”</p>

<p>His reaction of sympathy with the people of Finland fighting
against “servitude worse than death” is only one of countless examples
that could be named of the little-appreciated fact that he is
an extremely sensitive man. His gruff way sometimes conceals it,
but there is not a man in public life anywhere who feels the miseries
of this stricken world with more compassion than Churchill. When
eighteen months after these caustic remarks about the Communist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
regime, Russia was attacked and Mr. Churchill expressed his sympathy
with the Russian people, it is certain he meant it, although it
was good politics too. Incidentally I am convinced that one of the
reasons why he is loath to discuss detailed plans for what a victorious
Britain would like the postwar world to be, is the problem
of Russia. Certainly the vast majority of British people would like
to see the Bolshevik government replaced by some democratic
regime.</p>

<p>I am sure one reason for Churchill’s aversion to Bolshevism is his
strong family feeling, and his repugnance for the Communist attempt
to subordinate the family, if not to abolish it, as was originally
attempted in the Soviet Union. For his family in the past, his
noble and famous ancestors, he has profound respect and a feeling
of proud affectionate gratitude which has led him to devote a good
part of his literary labors to the biography of his father, Lord
Randolph Churchill, and to the massive life of the Duke of Marlborough.
To his present family, his wife Clementine, his daughters
Sarah, Diana, and Mary, and his son Randolph, he devotes more
time and attention than most men with a fraction of his responsibilities.
Randolph’s marriage to the beautiful Pamela Digby was a
delight to Mr. Churchill. It represented the only chance of the perpetuation
of the Churchill name, and when Winston Spencer, the
first grandchild to bear his name was born, he became the favorite
member of the dynasty.</p>

<p>Churchill’s aversions are just as strong and notable as his predilections.
They might be listed, without order: Hitler, Mussolini,
Trotzky, Nazism, Communism, the New Deal, Prohibition,
hypocrisy, cruelty, thick soup, bores, mediocrity, cowardice, stupidity,
sentimentality, bigotry, muddling, proletarianism, poor English,
poor food, poor anything except poor people. He is intolerant
of anything but the best. He is the perfect exemplar of a gentleman
who never offends anyone except intentionally. His manners to his
friends are of an old-fashioned courtliness. When he bids a guest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
farewell Mr. Churchill comes to the driveway to see him off with
a handshake and a Godspeed. His manners to his enemies are savage
and the lash of his tongue is feared from Berlin to Whitehall. He
can be wounding to a colleague who has failed to meet requirements.
One Cabinet Minister complained that when Churchill dismissed
him he “kicked me out as though I had been a servant.” As
the war wears on and the duties of office become heavier, his patience
has frayed and the single criticism one can frequently hear
is that he has become short-tempered. He is particularly intolerant
of Parliamentary inquiries which would require the Government
to reveal facts of military value to the enemy. Constantly, naive
Members ask such questions, and if Mr. Churchill chooses personally
to reply he frequently makes his answer blister. Yet there has
never been a Prime Minister with a more meticulous regard for the
rights, functions, and ceremonies of Parliament than Mr. Churchill.
This regard is such that he has sometimes been criticized for delaying
action until all forms are duly complied with by Parliament.</p>

<p>Churchill’s restless energy is such that his associates are both inspired
and compelled to work harder than they ever did with anyone
else. Shortly after he went to the Admiralty I visited his office
and chatted with his secretaries. They were obviously sincere in
their hero worship of him, but equally sincere in their sighs of
weariness over the strenuous schedule they have to follow. Rauschning
describes Hitler as an essentially lazy man who “does not
know how to work steadily. Indeed is incapable of working. He
hates to have to read with concentration. He rarely reads a book
through; usually he only begins it.” Could there be found a greater
contrast than this with the habits of Churchill whose perpetual industry
and powers of concentration are as important elements in
his genius as intellect? As an illustration of his ability to concentrate
I know no better anecdote than the one told me by Randolph.
It was during the months before the war when Mr. Churchill was
writing the <cite>History of the English Speaking Peoples</cite>, and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
day world without end, he turned out, generally in the evening,
his stint of words from 2,000 upward. It made no difference what
was happening in international affairs, or what other demands were
made upon his time. No excitements or exigencies were allowed to
disturb his writing. But events grew bigger and bigger and to the
prescient eye of Mr. Churchill it became every day more clear that
war was certain to come, and that a violent gesture by Hitler
might precipitate it any moment. Suddenly Hitler marched into
Prague, breaking the fresh vows he had made at Munich, deliberately
insulting Britain and France, cynically strangling the rump
state he had sworn to respect. Throughout Europe ran a shudder
and the mind of every man was absorbed with anxious exploration
of the possibilities. On that evening Mr. Churchill rose from dinner,
and as he started upstairs to his workroom to write his stint,
he exclaimed to his family, “It will be difficult for me tonight to
concentrate my undivided attention upon the reign of King James
II, but I shall do so.”</p>

<p>Another time I visited Chartwell with Randolph and as we
walked through the garden I saw a new brick building and remarked
that it had not been there before. “No,” Randolph explained.
“Father just built it.” “You mean, had it built?” I asked.
“Oh no, built it with his own hands.” I had heard about Mr.
Churchill’s bricklaying but had no idea it extended to building
whole houses. This one I found was his studio. He had laid every
brick in the building, and evidently was expert as a professional.
He particularly likes difficult jobs such as arches and corners
and curves. The Brick-layers Union at one time admitted him
to membership, but later called in his card on instructions from
the central office which objected to the Union’s accepting a Tory
politician as a member! This brick house, however, was not
built by any honorary bricklayer. If Mr. Churchill ever falls upon
evil times it may serve to recommend him for employment. While
Churchill, without having to do so and merely as a hobby, became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
a qualified artisan in the building trades, Hitler could not even out
of dire necessity keep a job in the building trades. Churchill might
earn a living also as a painter. The studio walls were hung from
top to bottom with the product of his brush, signed Charles Morin.
There were landscapes, seascapes, and every variety of scene, many
of them recording vacations on the French Riviera, his favorite
resort. Presently we joined Mr. Churchill swimming in the outdoor
pool he had also personally constructed. Later he played
cards with his wife. Six-pack bezique was the game. Guests had tea
on the lawn in the shade of the trees.</p>

<p>These were the last peaceful days before the hurricane which
it is fashionable to say will sweep away all that comfortable, easy,
country-home England. I do not believe it will do anything of the
kind. The war will certainly leave little of parasitic England. The
vast accumulations of inherited wealth are being swept now into
the hopper of war. It will no longer be possible for Francis Williams
to declare that eighty per cent of the wealth of England belongs
to six per cent of the population, and that nearly half of the
national income goes to ten percent of the people. But Churchill’s
type of good living, country house and all, will not disappear, for
it is based upon his own labors, as we could see demonstrated before
our eyes. After the card game Mr. Churchill went upstairs to
his workroom and about an hour later came down with the manuscript
of a 1,500-word article for the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> which he
had just dictated. I read it with professional envy, for in only a
few minutes he had produced one of his characteristic gems, informative,
learned, witty, for which he would receive a remuneration
about equivalent to the annual income of an average American
newspaperman. He frequently surpasses this feat in economizing
time. He used to write many of his newspaper articles on the way
up to London in his automobile, dictating to his secretary.</p>

<p>Churchill has now by act of Parliament completely dictatorial
powers and can order any British citizen to perform any service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
or can confiscate any property, but he has yet to be criticized for
ruling arbitrarily. He hates silly questions and will walk away from
a bore, or cut a hypocrite down with an epigram. Whisky, he believes,
is a boon to mankind, and he has never been the worse, but
often the better for it. The two men he most abhors in our time
are Hitler and Trotzky, both teetotalers. He is a gourmand, that is
to say a man with a sensitive taste in food who likes a lot of it.
Once he was in ill health and went to a noted specialist who, contrary
to the fashion of the day and despite the patient’s well-upholstered
body, advised him to eat more food. He follows the
prescription enthusiastically.</p>

<p>One night, about eighteen months before the war, traveling
from London to Paris, I had the good luck to be on the same train
with Mr. Churchill. After he had finished his work he invited
me to join him. All the way from London to Dover he had dictated
to a secretary who was to return to London. This is the way
he works, incessantly, never wasting a moment. Our train was
run onto a massive ferryboat, a new system of crossing the Channel
and this was Mr. Churchill’s first experience of it. It was bitterly
cold. Mr. Churchill wore a heavy fur-lined coat. We started
to explore the ferryboat. Word got about among the crew that
Winston Churchill was aboard, and speedily men gathered to salute
him and mention their service in the Royal Naval Volunteer
Reserve, which he organized. The Captain invited us to the bridge.
Steaming out of Dover harbor with an icy wind cutting our faces,
we listened as the Captain pointed out the lights of two wrecks
near the harbor and ventured the opinion that “You, Sir, I believe
ordered those ships sunk to block the harbor entrance to submarines?”
Mr. Churchill believed the skipper was right.</p>

<p>With unflagging energy Mr. Churchill led the way about the
ship from the bridge to the hold, stopping now and then to exchange
a few sentences with his admirers. Churchill had been out
of the government then for many years, but he remained the best-known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
figure in the realm and one could measure his popularity
by the reception he received on the ferryboat. Toward midnight
we climbed to the smoking room where Mr. Churchill as a nightcap
consumed a large platter of thick slices of rare roast beef with
the appetite of John Bull. As I watched him I thought to myself
that this is the way he deals with life, he devours it. When during
the quiet period of the war he made an intensive inspection of the
French and British positions and the Maginot line, French officers
were astonished at his ability to sit up with his hosts studying and
discussing the problems of war and probably a hundred other
things, including certainly the dry vintage champagne he likes so
well, and then appear again a few hours later at dawn for a hearty
breakfast with cigar! No Frenchmen and few of any other nationality
smoke cigars for breakfast, but Mr. Churchill finds them
invigorating. He is seldom without one in his waking hours.</p>

<p>The last time I visited him he received me at about 9:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
in the upper bedroom at Number Ten Downing Street. The Prime
Minister was sitting up in bed, cigar in mouth, hard at work with
a kind of bed desk in front of him to hold his papers, and pinned
within easy reaching distance on the wall a rack for various colored
folders to hold documents of different urgencies. This man who
might justly be called the most industrious human being on earth,
is a believer in the maxim of Mark Twain who did most of his
voluminous writing in bed: “A man’s a fool who runs when he can
stand still, or stands when he can sit down, or sits when he can
lie down.”</p>

<p>For serious writing Mr. Churchill requires the stimulus of striding
up and down, but he finds that for reading and working over
state papers and for dictating letters and memoranda, there is no
more efficient position than sitting up in bed. To sleep Mr.
Churchill does not necessarily require a bed, for such are his
powers of endurance that now in his sixty-seventh year he frequently
when on tours of inspection takes his night’s rest in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
automobile. I remember saying good-by to him one afternoon before
the Admiralty and as he was climbing into his car to drive to
one of the great naval ports, his aide-de-camp asked him where he
would spend the night. Mr. Churchill replied, “In the car driving
back.” No Prime Minister has ever moved about his constituency
so much, so tirelessly, and so dangerously as Mr. Churchill who
travels day and night by blackout and under bombardment. He
manages the total war effort of the Empire, but as he has repeatedly
emphasized, the war will be won or lost in the British Isles,
and inside this mighty fortress the Prime Minister gives the major
part of his attention to his duties as Commander in Chief. He is
incessantly on inspection.</p>

<p>Like the Captain of an old-time castle under siege, he roams
from battlement to battlement, from the South of England to the
North of Scotland, viewing the coast defenses, visiting naval stations,
driving the newest tanks, witnessing test flights of the latest
warplanes, cheering the R.A.F., the troops, the civilian population,
sharing their dangers, striding through the dust of bombs, and always
everywhere comprehending instantly, offering suggestions,
giving the orders of the expert he is in every branch of defense.
It is sometimes forgotten that if Hitler is indeed the Marshal in
Chief of the German war machine, so is Churchill of the British
war machine, and if Hitler has proved a military leader of intuitive
genius, Churchill has incomparably more experience and
scientific education in war, and certainly no less imagination than
Hitler even in the narrow field of strictly military affairs. Hitler
had four years of the last war as a private and corporal; has read
military history; since he became Chancellor has had the counsel
of the Prussian General Staff; and now has had two years’ experience
of war. Churchill’s military education began with the
exacting instruction of Sandhurst and for practical experience
in old-fashioned combat he witnessed or took part in the Boer
War, the River War in India, civil war in Cuba, and the Sudan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
campaign. In the first World War he helped direct the struggle
from one of its most important posts, the Admiralty, conceived the
tank and numerous other new devices of war, fought in France as
a colonel, and all the while before and since, studied and wrote
about war until he became one of its foremost historians. These
experiences and studies are those of a Doctor of Philosophy compared
to Hitler’s grammar school course. In the long run, granting
all of Hitler’s genius, I am convinced Churchill, given the tools,
will win&mdash;but not without America.</p>

<p>You may object that it seems absurd to compare favorably the
military abilities of a commander of forces which have constantly
been on the defensive with those of the chief of troops so far ever
victorious. But the war is a long way from its end, and before that
goal is reached, the military qualifications of Churchill may prove
their superiority over Hitler’s. Churchill has not yet had the opportunity
to show what he can do as a war leader pitted with
equal weapons against the enemy, because the war machine he inherited
from the feeble hands of Chamberlain was for a long time
capable of nothing but defense. Meanwhile as the British plus
American war machine is growing, it is encouraging to remember
that Churchill with his background of forty years of war, study
of war and leadership in war, his youthful inventive mind and
eager imagination, is capable of taking everything the Germans
have devised or used successfully, and improving it until with the
eventually superior resources he will command, victory will be
certain, provided always that the United States enters the war in
time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">4. WAR AIMS</h2>
</div>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What are Britain’s war aims?</em></p>

<p>A. We Americans may still find it interesting to inquire “What
are they fighting for?” but if we stood in the midst of the ruins of
Westminster Abbey or the House of Commons, it would not occur
to us to ask the question. Mr. Churchill has joined President Roosevelt
in a formal statement, the so-called Atlantic Charter, but it
seems to me that he has twice expressed himself far more eloquently
and accurately than he did in the Eight Points. In those dread days
when despair touched nearly every soul but his, and he had just
accepted the responsibility of leading his country at the moment
of its greatest peril, Mr. Churchill said: “You ask what is our
policy? I say: It is to wage war by sea, land and air, with all our
might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war
against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable
catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask,
what is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory! Victory at
all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and
hard the way may be; for without victory there is no survival.”</p>

<p>Simple survival does not seem enough for some comfortably situated
critics in this country sheltered by British resistance, but that is
only because it is so difficult for those who have not experienced
the near threat of death to understand what life means. Mr.
Churchill expressed the irritation at such questions that must seize
anyone who has witnessed the effect of Hitler’s terrible force when
in a discussion of Poland he exclaimed: “What a frightful fate has
overtaken Poland! Here was a community of nearly thirty-five millions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
of people with all the organization of a modern government
and all the traditions of an ancient state, which in a few weeks was
dashed out of civilized existence to become an incoherent multitude
of tortured and starving men, women and children, ground beneath
the heel of two rival forms of withering and blasting tyranny. Although
the fate of Poland stares them in the face, there are thoughtless
dilettanti or purblind worldlings who sometimes ask us: ‘What
is it that Britain is fighting for?’ To this I answer, ‘If we left off
fighting you would soon find out.’”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>I understand that, but after victory, what? That won’t be the
end of the world; after we win we shall have a lot to do. What was
the meaning of the Churchill-Roosevelt meeting and their eight-point
declaration?</em></p>

<p>A. The meeting and its published result, which Churchill calls
the Atlantic Charter, made an interesting commentary and answer
to the demand for a statement of war aims. Its first importance lay
in the fact of the meeting of the two men; its second importance
lay in the confidential discussion of ways and means of beating
Hitler; its third importance was a statement of war aims. I have not
been able to understand why the statement was labeled in this
country as an American statement, as though the President had imposed
it upon the Prime Minister, or as though the principal ideas
contained in it were characterized more by American unselfishness
than by British hardheadedness. It may very well be that Churchill
was reluctant to make any statement of war aims at all, but now
that it has been made it seems to me to be hardheaded, and frankly
Churchillian and not at all the sort of statement that American
liberals had been discussing.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why not; is there anything not liberal in the statement?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span></p>

<p>A. Not to my way of thinking, but the average liberal argued there
should be a statement of war aims in order first of all to impress the
good German people that we are kindly disposed toward them and
if they knew how well we intended to treat them after they were
defeated they would give up now. What is the sense of the Atlantic
Charter? Its chief meaning is that the main war aim and peace aim
is to make the world safe against Germany. It names two ways of
accomplishing this aim: A. By destruction of the Nazi power and
disarmament of Germany and her allies. B. By restoration of the
nations now enslaved. Does this constitute an encouragement for
the Germans to give up? Hardly. Churchill and Roosevelt were too
clear-sighted and too candid to fall in with the argument that the
German people could be fooled by a dishonest statement of war
aims. They knew that the Germans are bound to realize if they lose
this war they will be worse off than if they win. War is Hell, but
much more hellish for the defeated side. It is untrue that war never
settles anything. It always settles something, whether for a short
time, as for the twenty years following the uncompleted war of
1914-1918, or forever as the Third Punic War. The Germans
know this better than almost any other people. But now they have
had a crushingly frank statement of basic British-American war
aims: abolition of German military power. This time they cannot
complain they have been deceived.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Wasn’t that true of Wilson’s Fourteen Points? Weren’t they a
frank statement to the Germans of the terms they could expect if
they surrendered?</em></p>

<p>A. No. In the first place, one great difference between Wilson’s
Fourteen Points and the Eight Points of the Atlantic Charter is that
Wilson acted alone, and issued his Fourteen Points to the world in
January 1918, without consulting Britain or France, so that when
the Germans in October finally in the extremity of defeat accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
them, Britain and France were not bound by them at all. In the
second place, the Fourteen Points declared there should be general
disarmament, and not just a one-sided German disarmament, so that
when as a matter of common prudence, the British and French insisted
upon and obtained German disarmament ahead of their own,
the Germans protested they had been betrayed by Wilson particularly
and by the Allies in general. Hitler based his campaign for
power in Germany largely upon his complaint that Germany had
never been fairly beaten on the battlefield, but had been betrayed
by the Fourteen Points. Now it is hard to see how any future
Hitler can raise again such a complaint since the Germans are now
given fair warning that when they are beaten their present government
will be abolished, and their arms will be taken from them
while the British and Americans keep their arms intact. This is a
refreshing example of common-sense honesty. It seems almost as
though Churchill’s and Roosevelt’s clear-sighted candor might
finally brush away the mists of false feeling and thinking which
have obscured our view of the war and of our own interests.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You have named what might be called a negative side of the
Atlantic Charter as being its most important side.</em></p>

<p>A. It is, if you call it negative to aim to destroy the power which
has torn the whole world apart.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Yes, but after that power is destroyed, or rendered impotent,
what are we or the British going to do to consolidate the gains of
victory? How are we going to be better off?</em></p>

<p>A. If you think we are going to be better off, or could be better
off than we were before 1939, the answer is that we cannot be because
no matter which side wins the world as a whole is going to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
very much worse off for a long time than it was before the war
began. We are not offered the choice now of fighting in order to
improve our present position. Our choice is, either to fight and save
something of our most precious spiritual as well as material possessions;
or not to fight and lose everything. The world as a whole is
bound to be materially much poorer after this war no matter who
is victor, although the United States ought to come out of it in better
condition than any other country. Think of the immense demolition
which has been wrought and is now being wrought in Europe.
Just to name a few of the cities which have been bombarded and
have suffered varying degrees of damage is to compile a roll of
casualties never equaled: London, Manchester, Liverpool, Portsmouth,
Southampton, Plymouth, Coventry; Berlin, Hamburg,
Bremen, Cologne, Duisburg, Essen, Dortmund; Warsaw; Belgrade;
Leningrad, Moscow, Minsk, Smolensk, Odessa, Kiev; Alexandria;
Nanking, Hankow, Chungking. From China to Egypt and from
England to Central Russia, fire and high explosives have blasted
scars it will take a century to heal.</p>

<p>The diversion of billions of man-hours from productive work to
the making of war supplies, the loss of lives, and the dislocation of
millions of human existences, and of the whole world economy,
will impoverish us all for a certain length of time. Happily there
are reasons for believing the United States will suffer less than almost
any other part of the human family, provided only that we
enter the war soon enough to ensure the defeat of the Nazi
power and do not wait to face that power alone. We must keep
one thing firmly in mind, that though our condition may be poor
if we are victorious, it will be definitely better than if we are defeated,
and though we may lack in goods and comforts as a result
of our participation in the war, we shall be far richer and easier in
body, mind, and soul after hard-won victory than if we attempted
to purchase from the conquering Nazis a humiliating security.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why should the United States, as you suggested, come out of
the war in a better economic condition than the others?</em></p>

<p>A. First, because if we enter the war in time to have any Allies, we
shall probably be physically undamaged. That is, as long as the
British Isles, our foremost fortress, persists in its resistance it is not
likely that we shall suffer any important injuries by air bombardment
or otherwise. You can see how important this factor is if you
consider the condition of the cities of England now, and how much
money, labor, and time it will take to restore them. Second, the
economic structure of the United States can more easily be transferred
back from war to peace production than most countries.
After this war there will be an increase in the private use of airplanes
comparable to the increase in automobile ownership after
the first successful Ford. Our warplane production can be easily
switched to the production of private planes, and many observers
would not be surprised to see American private plane production
go into six figures and then into seven.</p>

<p>The United States, as the most self-contained of the belligerent
powers, at the end of the war will have everything necessary to
resume its own economic progress and to help the world recover.</p>

<p>Europe will be starving and desperately in need of our agricultural
products, our cotton, and of almost everything else we produce.
If we wish decisively to influence the organization of the
world, one powerful lever will be our economic power after the
war, our ability if we like, to finance the reconstruction of Europe.
With wisdom and far-sight in control of our administration we
ought to be able to put back into circulation some of our monstrous
hoard of gold, for our own good as well as that of the world. Sometimes
when one succumbs to optimism, it seems possible that there
may come after this war a marvelous opportunity to reshape the
affairs of mankind into a happier pattern. We shall have an opportunity
such as we have never had before, not even after the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
war, to make our hopes and aspirations practically effective, but
only of course if we enter the war in time. There is a fourth reason
why we should be economically or financially better off at the
end of this war than at the end of the last one: we now have no
war-debt problem. Who will deny now that everyone would have
been better off after the last war if international debts, including
reparations, had been canceled all around. This aspect of the Lend-Lease
program may go down in history as Roosevelt’s cleverest
device.</p>

<p>This sounds almost as though I thought the war would be a blessing
to America, emerging undamaged, easily reverting to peacetime
production, stored with goods for our own consumption and for
export to clamoring millions abroad, and with no delinquent war
debtors to confuse our financial affairs. Actually I do not think
the war will be a blessing, except as it unifies us and does something
to cleanse us of the scum of materialism. This view of
America’s chances of coming relatively unscathed out of the war
depends entirely upon comparison of our fate with that of other
countries, maimed by bombardment, mutilated by the loss of millions
of breadwinners, fiscally bankrupt, economically paralyzed,
politically divided, and in the case of some, the prey of anarchy.
Think what the problem of leadership will be in most of the countries
of Europe. In Germany and Italy the tyrants have long ago
executed, imprisoned, exiled or otherwise effectively removed from
the political scene every possible candidate for office not in agreement
with them. In France the demoralization caused by defeat and
Vichy’s collaboration with the enemy has left few men with the
initiative and courage to become leaders of a renascent republic.
If, as so frequently happens, we become inclined to take an over-cheerful
view of ourselves and our prospects, we ought to be sobered
by the thought of our responsibilities in the postwar world.
Whether we like it or not, and our isolationists to the contrary notwithstanding,
the United States after this war is going to be compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
to assume the leadership of the Western World, not only
economically but politically. But we shall be able effectively to influence
the peace only if we have effectively taken part in the war.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What will the peace conference be like?</em></p>

<p>A. It might be more instructive in the first place to discuss what
the peace will be like if Hitler wins. Of course there will not be
any peace <em>conference</em> if Hitler wins. The Quislings and Darlans
will be called to function for the states of Europe in the same way
as Hitler’s rubber-stamp Reichstag functions for Germany. We
know now what Hitler plans to impose upon the world. Let us
begin with Europe. Europe is to belong exclusively to the Germans.
They as a master race will occupy the top of a pyramid at the
bottom of which are the Poles, Czechs, Serbs, and other “subhuman
Slavs” who constitute the lowest class of slaves. Between these “untouchables”
and the Germans will come all the other peoples of
Europe, arranged in order depending partially upon their degree
of racial kinship with the noble Teutons, but more on the degree
of their subservience and “collaboration.” The Dutch and Scandinavians,
for example, are considered by the Nazis to be semi-Teutonic
cousins, but they will not be ranked as high as the
French if the Vichy appeasers succeed in their policy of “collaboration.”</p>

<p>Now that Italy has proved an even feebler war partner than her
worst detractors had imagined, Hitler obviously is considering the
grant to France of the position of First Vassal instead of Italy.
Spain, if she eventually enters the war, will be given a role perhaps
second to that of Italy, chiefly because Spanish influence will be
helpful in the conquest of South America. Sweden and Switzerland
will of course be <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gleichgeschaltet</i>, or “coordinated” into the Nazi
system and given a rank corresponding to their servility. But all are
slaves, including the Axis “allies” Italy, Hungary, Spain, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
differ one from another only in the degree of their degradation.
None of them will be permitted to bear arms capable of threatening
their Nazi masters, and none will have a word in the formulation
of the major laws which determine their lives.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>In what sense will the conquered people be slaves?</em></p>

<p>A. Politically, they will be disfranchised, without a vote, unable
to influence their own fate except by humble petition to Berlin.
For the most part they will be ruled by Nazi governors. States like
Poland will also have Nazis ruling the smallest organs of government,
as municipalities. States like France may be permitted to
operate their own provincial and municipal governments under a
Nazi <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gauleiter fuer Frankreich</i>.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But Germans also have no vote under the Nazi system. How
does the position of these other nationalities under the Nazis differ
from that of the Germans themselves?</em></p>

<p>A. It differs as the night from day. Every ruling made and every
action taken by the Nazi governors of the vassal states is intended
to procure tribute for the Great German Reich, tribute which,
scientifically extracted, will prove greater over the years than any
amount of old-fashioned looting could have produced. This tribute,
which is to be paid not merely for generations to come, but as
Hitler modestly estimates, for 1,000 years, will go to elevate the
standard of living of all Germans, and to depress the standard of
living of all non-Germans. It makes no difference that most Germans
have no voice in their government; every German will be
under Hitler’s New Order, a slaveholder, and every non-German
inhabitant of occupied territory is automatically a slave of the
whole German tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How is this to be accomplished? Isn’t it difficult to extract tribute?
Didn’t the Allies have trouble getting reparations from Germany?</em></p>

<p>A. The Allies were innocent children compared with the Nazis in
the art of obtaining advantage from one’s beaten adversary. No
one knows whether Hitler’s system will work for 1,000 years, or
for ten or two years, but it certainly is a grandiose design without
any parallel in the history of human conquest. First is the movement
of populations. Hitler has moved upward of two million Poles
from Western Poland, dumped them indiscriminately in Central
Poland, and replaced them with Germans, some from the Baltic
states, some from the Tyrol, some from the Reich. The Poles as a
rule were visited by the Gestapo after midnight, given half an
hour’s notice to leave their homes forever, allowed to take but a
single suitcase with food for three days and the clothes on their
backs. They were forbidden to take any of their own articles of
value, not even a silver spoon from the kitchen or a rake from
the barn. The German families moving in were fewer than the
evacuated Poles, so that the Germans became wealthier per capita
than the Poles had been. The Poles died for the most part, or else
are still in process of dying from starvation and exposure; it was
part of the German calculation that they should die. Similar
methods were used to evacuate the French from Lorraine.</p>

<p>Other desirable parts of Europe contiguous to the Great German
Reich will be evacuated of their native populations and settled by
the Germans. This constitutes looting on a grand scale. Sir Norman
Angell, profound thinker on war, once held in his Nobel prize-winning
thesis “The Great Illusion,” that modern conquest cannot
pay in this Christian day and age, because the acquisition of mere
political control over an enemy’s territory, the advancing of the
flag over foreign lands, does not pay even for the cost of the war.
The usual incidental looting by the soldiery amounts of course to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
nothing from the point of view of the nation’s economics. Sir
Norman could not be blamed for failing to foresee the grand-scale
looting practiced by the Nazis. There is an evident economic advantage
to the nation if a million of its farm families are moved
into rich, fully equipped farms robbed from the conquered and
expelled enemy. But this sort of looting is only the beginning of
Nazi total plunder. In France the major part of the productive
apparatus in industry, trade, and the professions is being systematically
taken over by the Nazis. This is only a step toward the huge
permanent system of eternal tribute, which is based upon the exploitation
of the labor power of Europe.</p>

<p>No conqueror since the Romans has ever been able profitably to
exploit the labor power of his conquests, but the Nazis propose to
do so and are doing so and boast they will continue to do so for
centuries. The Nazis intend to concentrate all industry in Germany,
and to convert the rest of Europe into an agricultural colony growing
food and raw materials for the master state, the Great German
Reich. The entire population of non-German Europe is to be
turned and is already being turned as fast as possible into a vast
army of coolies of the soil, toiling to supply the Third Reich. The
coolies will likewise be required to buy all their industrial products
from Germany. The price the Germans pay for the coolies’ agricultural
products and the price the coolies pay for the German
goods will be fixed by the Germans. Nice calculation will arrive at
the precise prices which will bring the Herrenvolk the maximum
advantage. The Germans with their traditional scientific acumen
will certainly find it to their advantage to pay their coolies such
prices for agricultural products as will enable the coolies to buy
liberally of German manufactured goods.</p>

<p>Thus with a little reasonableness and spirit of accommodation
on the side of the coolies, who ought to be happy to give up the
responsibility of liberty, and glad to dispense with the obligations
connected with free speech, press, assembly, and thought, Hitler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Europe might settle down into one great unhappy family, orderly
as a penitentiary, quiet as a grave. It is important also to note that
by turning their conquered populations into farm hands the Nazis
make it much easier to keep their victims permanently disarmed,
since only industry on a large scale can turn out tanks, machine
guns, and warplanes necessary for insurrection against a totalitarian
tyranny.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But Hitler has not destroyed or removed the factories from
France and not even from Poland, since we constantly read that
he is obtaining considerable war supplies from the industrial plants
in the occupied regions.</em></p>

<p>A. That is because the war is not over yet and Hitler has not had
time to move these factories into Germany. He needs their products
immediately for the war against England and Russia. After his
conquest of Poland he kept many Polish factories, notably locomotive
and freight-car plants, running in Poland with German supervisors,
but after the fall of France, during that period when he
was sure England would capitulate also, he ordered these factories
transferred to Germany. Then after the British failed to surrender
and as soon as it became plain that the war would last some time
longer, Hitler countermanded the transfer of the Polish factories,
and many of them are running today on Polish soil.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Where is Hitler going to get the man power to run such a huge
industrial machine, comprising the manufactories formerly owned
in all the rest of Europe?</em></p>

<p>A. That is a question which closely concerns us all in America.
Hitler will get the man power in part from his own partially demobilized
armies, but in part also from the conquered coolies, millions
of whom are not agricultural workers at all, but skilled mechanics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
and technicians. German authorities admit, or boast, that
today 2,000,000 prisoners of war and “others” are working in German
factories, mines, and on farms. It is against the products of this
essentially slave labor that American industrial products would
have to compete if Hitler after conquering Britain offered merely
to compete with the United States in foreign trade.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Would we not then be at a great disadvantage? How could
we compete at all?</em></p>

<p>A. We could not compete successfully. Under the Nazi system,
precisely as under its twin brother, the Soviet system, all foreign
trade is carried on by a foreign trade monopoly. It has a hundred
different names in Germany but in reality every foreign trade
transaction is a government transaction. Competition among Germans
is thus eliminated and any foreigner attempting to compete
with the Nazi Colossus has as much chance to succeed as a one-well
oil producer trying to trade against the Standard Oil Company.
No American manufacturer, no matter how big, including
our automobile manufacturers, could buck the Nazi machine, because
in addition to its slave labor prices, and its government
foreign trade monopoly, it would have the advantage of terrific
political-military pressure on all the states in the world not yet an
integral part of the Nazi Empire. What South American state do
you think would have the nerve to stand up to a Germany which
had just finished off the whole of Europe and the British Empire?
Which one of them would refuse to give Nazi goods favored tariff
treatment over American goods notwithstanding any existing
treaties?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>If these are Hitler’s plans for Europe, what does he intend to
do with Africa, Asia, and America if he wins?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span></p>

<p>A. He intends to swallow piece by piece the entire world, but
since he cannot do so by immediate, world-wide conquest, he
would like to be allowed periods of negotiated peace during which
he could allow his forces to recuperate while by soothing reassurances
he lulls that part of the world not yet under his dominion,
into a state of helplessness. If he could, after the conquest of Russia,
make a negotiated peace with Britain and tacitly, with the United
States, he would expect, after a breathing spell, to be stronger relative
to the combined strength of Britain and America than he is
now. When his superiority in strength had reached a certain point,
he would attack again.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How could Hitler expect to be stronger since we are now
building our two-ocean Navy and our great Air Force and Army?
Even if Hitler were now or soon to obtain negotiated peace,
wouldn’t we continue to forge ahead and grow stronger?
Wouldn’t we in the face of a Hitler-dominated world which
would result from a negotiated peace be compelled to turn the
United States into an armed camp, and wouldn’t we increase our
armaments until we were invulnerable?</em></p>

<p>A. That is not at all certain. If we continue in our present state of
complacency, we might take a negotiated peace to be a sign that
we could disarm. The House of Representatives passed the bill extending
the service of selectees beyond one year by a vote of 203
to 202. One vote preserved the existence of our embryo army.
It was not a mere technical question of how long an army man
ought to serve. The question was whether we were to have an
army at all. In the midst of the war, when every qualified expert
declared the United States faced mortal perils, the House of Representatives
could find a majority of but one-tenth of one per cent in
favor of maintaining or attempting to construct an effective army.
I know the majority would have been larger if the administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
leaders had known the vote could come so close, but the fact remains
that in this crisis of our national life, with the enemy rampant
and untamed, the House took this complacent view of our
defense necessities.</p>

<p>Now what would be the attitude of Congress if a peace should
be negotiated? Would not our isolationists say this was a God-given
opportunity to reduce our tremendous expenditures, whittle
the Army down to police size, confine our Air Force to a few
thousand planes, and stop building our two-ocean Navy? Certainly
they would, and all the immense propaganda resources of the Nazis
would be employed to encourage throughout the United States
such a move toward “common-sense pacifism.” Now, the argument
would run, the war is over, Hitler is satisfied, let us go back
to normalcy. Whether we actually succumbed entirely to this
temptation or not, there would be a strong isolationist campaign
in favor of our disarmament, and this would surely slow up our
defense effort. Meanwhile Hitler would be bringing his New
Order slave states with their industries and agriculture into the
service of the Reich, increasing his Navy, rebuilding his Air Force,
re-equipping his Army and in general growing stronger relative to
us. He would never want a negotiated peace unless he believed
this would be its result.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Have you any idea what kind of negotiated peace Hitler
would consider acceptable? Would such a peace be as desirable
for us as Wheeler and Lindbergh say? I notice Lindbergh recently
urged that the only alternative to a negotiated peace was “either
a Hitler victory or a prostrate Europe or a prostrate Europe and
possibly a prostrate America as well.”</em></p>

<p>A. Fortunately Axis sources have given us a rather complete
blueprint of what they would consider acceptable terms of a
negotiated peace. Reduced to a few words, their terms are: Surrender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
by Britain and America of control of the seas by reduction
of the British and American navies to parity with the Axis and
demilitarization of British and American naval bases outside home
waters; German dominion over all Europe, most of Africa, and
parts of Asia; Japanese control of the rest of Asia; and the United
States to open the doors of Latin America to Axis enterprise.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do you mean that those are serious terms suggested for a so-called
negotiated peace? What is the source of these terms?</em></p>

<p>A. It is the version put out by the Japanese Foreign Office
through its organ the <cite>Japan Times Advertiser</cite>, April 29, 1941, as a
trial balloon. It remains the most comprehensive statement of Axis
terms yet issued. Since the British government ignored it, and the
British and American press derided it, Germany dropped the idea
for the moment, but you may be sure it has not been dropped for
good. Seven weeks after its publication Hitler sent his armies into
Russia. When he has attained his goal there, it seems highly probable
he will again offer peace and when he does, the general outline
of his terms will probably follow this statement. One has only to
remember that since the issuance of this provisional peace text
Russia has been stricken from the list of “the nations called upon
to settle world peace” and has been added as a victim.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But didn’t the meeting of Churchill and Roosevelt exclude the
possibility of a negotiated peace, since they declared in their eight-point
program that “final destruction of the Nazi tyranny” was
the precondition to peace?</em></p>

<p>A. They did, but Hitler, though he may have little hope of actually
achieving a negotiated peace, may offer it in order to appeal
over the heads of Churchill and Roosevelt to those elements of the
British and American populations he considers vulnerable to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
propaganda. There are few such elements left in England, but
many here. Hitler knows by now that he has only to furnish the
ammunition and Lindbergh and Wheeler will do the firing for
him.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Have you the text of these Hitler terms?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, and it would be most instructive to compare it with the
eight-point Atlantic Charter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center largefont"><span class="smcap">Joint Declaration</span></p>

<p>The President of the United States of America and the Prime
Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty’s Government
in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make
known certain common principles in the national policies of their
respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better
future of the world.</p>

<p>First: Their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or
other;</p>

<p>Second: They desire to see no territorial changes that do not
accord with the freely expressed wishes of the people concerned;</p>

<p>Third: They desire to respect the right of all peoples to choose
the form of government under which they will live; and they wish
to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who
have been forcibly deprived of them;</p>

<p>Fourth: They will endeavor, with due respect for their existing
obligations, to further the enjoyment by all states, great or small,
victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and
to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their
economic prosperity;</p>

<p>Fifth: They desire to bring about the fullest collaboration
between all nations in the economic field, with the object of securing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and
social security;</p>

<p>Sixth: After the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they
hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the
means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and
which will afford assurance that all the men in the lands may live
out their lives in freedom from fear and want;</p>

<p>Seventh: Such a peace should enable all men to traverse the
high seas and oceans without hindrance;</p>

<p>Eighth: They believe that all of the nations of the world, for
realistic as well as spiritual reasons, must come to the abandonment
of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if
land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations
which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers,
they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent
system of general security, that the disarmament of such
nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other
practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples
the crushing burden of armaments.</p>

<p class="ir2"><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt.</em><br />
<em>Winston S. Churchill.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="p1">To this the President added in his message to Congress: “It is
also unnecessary for me to point out that the declaration of principles
includes of necessity the world need for freedom of religion
and freedom of information. No society of the world organized
under the announced principles could survive without these freedoms
which are a part of the whole freedom for which we strive.”
And Mr. Churchill made this significant comment in his broadcast:
“There are, however, two distinct and marked differences in this
joint declaration from the attitude adopted by the Allies during
the latter part of the last war, and no one should overlook them.
The United States and Great Britain do not now assume that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
will never be any more war again. On the contrary, we intend to
take ample precautions to prevent its renewal in any period we
can foresee by effectively disarming the guilty nations while remaining
suitably protected ourselves. The second difference is
this: That instead of trying to ruin German trade by all kinds
of additional trade barriers and hindrances as was the mood of
1917, we have definitely adopted the view that it is not in the
interests of the world and of our two countries that any large
nation should be unprosperous, or shut off from means of making
a decent living for itself and its people by industry and enterprise.
These are far-reaching changes of principle upon which all countries
should ponder.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Axis statement begins with the declaration that the day of
small or weak nations is over, and no nation which cannot stand
on its own feet may be permitted to exist.</p>

<p>“1. The strongest powers must have the greatest opportunities
of developing the world and disposing of such questions as spheres
of influence, resources, and type of government. This is the law
of nature and attempts to maintain the status quo of dominant
powers who cannot continue to function through their strength
but only through alliances must break down.”</p>

<p>The reference here of course is to such colonial powers as
France, Holland, Belgium, etc.</p>

<p>“2. The nations called upon to settle world peace would be
Germany, with Italy as a junior partner, Japan, the British Empire,
and the United States. Such a peace should include: a. Parity of
naval strength of Britain and the United States on one hand, and
the Axis powers on the other hand, with a naval holiday after this
is established.”</p>

<p>This is the key to the intention of the whole peace. Since the
British and American navies are about double the strength of the
Axis powers, so long as the British hold out we together could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
continue effectively to control the seas. If we were to consent to
a naval agreement reducing our and the British strength to the
strength of the Axis, and at the same time demilitarize our naval
bases as demanded in other paragraphs, effective sea power would
pass to the Axis.</p>

<p>“b. Demilitarization of such strongholds as Gibraltar, the Eastern
Mediterranean, Malta, Aden, Red Sea, Singapore, and Hong Kong,
as well as all United States bases in the Pacific and any projects in
the Aleutian Islands reaching out toward Japan.”</p>

<p>This paragraph would complete the conquest of sea power by
the Axis and would render defenseless all the British Empire’s Far
Eastern possessions and our Philippines and Alaska.</p>

<p>“c. Complete withdrawal of the British Navy from the Mediterranean
and joint Anglo-Axis administration of the Suez Canal.”</p>

<p>Withdrawal of the British Navy would give mastery of the
Mediterranean to the Axis, which would automatically control
the Suez Canal. To offer “joint Anglo-Axis administration of the
Suez Canal” is a sop which only underlines the grotesque nature
of a Hitler-negotiated peace.</p>

<p>“d. All North Africa from the Straits of Gibraltar to Somaliland
to be placed at the disposition of the Axis, though France may be
permitted to retain colonies under certain conditions of co-administration.
Certain British and African colonies to be placed under
German and Italian control. South Africa would be required to
have complete independence and abolish trade preference tariffs.”</p>

<p>The last sentence means that South Africa should leave the
British Empire. The fleeting, condescending mention of the French
who <em>may</em> be permitted to share colonies is the only reference made
to them. It ought to be noted carefully by the men of Vichy who
pretend at any rate to believe that Hitler would not rob them if
they abased themselves sufficiently. For the United States, the
significant thing here is that Germany would control the naval,
air, and military bases of Africa including Dakar opposite Brazil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<p>“e. Continental Europe to be organized into a corporate state
under the Reich with domestic autonomy for unit members whose
economic and political cooperation would be based on Berlin.”</p>

<p>There for all to read is the future map of Europe. The name of
Europe itself will scarcely be needed any more, save as a geographical
term once used to identify the continent now known
as Great Germany. No more France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark,
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland. All will come under the Nazi
yoke, even Spain and Portugal and the states which yielded without
a struggle, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria. You ask, but isn’t
this the unification of Europe we have all been hoping for? The
answer is no, because what the world needed was a Europe voluntarily
united in a United States of Europe, or whatever else you
wanted to call it, for the purpose of promoting the mutual prosperity,
health, and happiness of all its members. Hitler Europe’s
avowed object is to confiscate and exploit the resources of the
conquered states and to employ their man power as slaves for the
exclusive, perpetual benefit of the “master race.” This is not a new
Commonwealth of Nations; it is the first step in the Nazis’ program
for the systematic degradation of the human race. The only
parallel for it is in Aldous Huxley’s <cite>Brave New World</cite>. His robot
human race was divided into Alpha masters and various classes of
slaves, down to the Epsilon automatons who would correspond
to Hitler’s Slavic serfs.</p>

<p>“f. The United Kingdom to remain the heart of the British
Empire with a gradual transfer of authority to Canada.”</p>

<p>This seems to be a covert bid for isolationist approval in the
United States, a hint that as the British Empire will not exist at
all much longer, the United States may profit by absorbing Canada
and whatever other vestigial remnants of the Empire may be
granted Canada as the residuary legatee. This profit-taking by the
United States has already been proposed by Lindbergh in his
suggestion that we take over Canada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span></p>

<p>“g. The German sphere of influence may go as far as the Sea
of Marmora unless that were handed over to the joint administration
of Turkey and Soviet Russia. But Germany may demand
participation in the oil wells of Iraq and Iran.”</p>

<p>This paragraph has been rendered obsolete by the German invasion
of Russia. Germany certainly hopes eventually to get all
the oil of Iraq and Iran.</p>

<p>“h. The United States’ sphere of influence would be Canada,
Central and South America, Newfoundland, and Greenland with
islands and regional waters, but the United States would undertake
not to form any hegemony over South America inimical to the
Axis and would accord the fullest freedom and equality of opportunity
to Germany and her Allies in that continental brotherhood.
No American naval bases would be west of Hawaii, and that
stronghold would be reduced in importance.”</p>

<p>How does it feel to an American to hear this sort of dictation?
It is dignified treatment compared with what we would receive if
we acceded. Never was a proverb more true than the old Russian
one, based on the bitter experience of their vassalage to the Tartars.
“A nation is never too poor to pay the first installment of
tribute and never rich enough to pay the last.” We are asked to
give up all our naval bases in the Pacific west of Hawaii, but there
is no hint of Japanese reciprocity. The Japanese when the time
came would move in and fortify the bases we had dismantled.</p>

<p>“i. In the Pacific the Netherlands Indies might be detached from
the Netherlands and placed under an independent government
with native participation, and British possessions would obtain
increasing independence. Throughout all these Pacific islands,
Japanese advisors would be admitted and entrusted with the duty
of rationalizing forms of cooperation in the ‘co-prosperity sphere.’
French Indo-China would receive independence on the same
terms.”</p>

<p>We see now what this “independence” is. Just twelve weeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
after the publication of these “peace terms” the Japanese took over
Indo-China.</p>

<p>These peace terms are not even hypocritically polite. They
simply assume the opposite “negotiators” are beaten, and that of
course includes the United States, as we may see from our prominent
position among its stipulations. Lindbergh declares we would
be beaten from the start if we entered the war, and that a negotiated
peace would be more acceptable than outright military
defeat. But these terms, vouched for by the Imperial Japanese
Foreign Office organ, show us that we would be treated as a
conquered nation if we negotiated a peace.</p>

<p>“j. Australia would remain within the British Empire, but would
eliminate immigration bars and allow Japanese settlement on terms
of equality.”</p>

<p>The exclusively Japanese interests would be safeguarded by
Germany in a negotiated peace only if Japan had earned it by
following German orders. Japan, however, may disappoint her
senior partner.</p>

<p>The next to last paragraph reads ironically:</p>

<p>“k. India would obtain self-government.”</p>

<p>We may be sure that if the Axis wins, India will not receive
self-government. Both Germany and Japan want India. Somewhere
in the path of this war appears the possibility of a clash between
the Germans and the Japanese. Already Japan shows signs of being
afraid that if Germany wins, Japan will suffer the same fate as
Italy and Russia. Japan likewise shows signs of wanting to wait
for better evidence that the Allies are going to win. Stranger
things have happened in this war than that Japan should finally
quit the Axis and go to war on the side of Britain and the United
States.</p>

<p>But the most ironic paragraph of this peace offer is the last:</p>

<p>“l. Religious and political liberty would be enjoined throughout
the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span></p>

<p>That’s all. That completes the offer of negotiated peace.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why do they call it a negotiated peace?</em></p>

<p>A. It is not “negotiated.” It is a dictated peace; it represents a
complete Hitler victory but that is the only kind of negotiated
peace he would consider until he is himself defeated.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But is it possible that these are authentic, genuine terms of the
Axis? It seems to me that the publication of such arrogant demands
upon America was an undiplomatic step, contrary to the interests
of the Axis, since it would be bound to arouse our indignation.</em></p>

<p>A. It was a “semi-official” publication of the Japanese Foreign
Office at the very time when the then Foreign Minister Matsuoka
advised Anthony Eden that Japan was ready to mediate a negotiated
peace if she were requested to do so. Its authentic character
can hardly be questioned. If it is arrogant it is because the Axis is
arrogant, and considers that Britain is already beaten and that the
United States was beaten before she began to fight. As the <cite>Japan
Times Advertiser</cite> put it: “These may be called victors’ terms but
the Axis powers have achieved a dominant position permitting liberty
of dictation.” These terms could not be worse if we had entered
the war and lost it. They would mean that from now on
until perhaps centuries later when the Nazis shall have become soft
and self-indulgent and until some new, rougher race arose to oust
them, the Germans would rule the earth. For of course if Britain
or America were to be willing to accept such terms it would prove
they really were beaten.</p>

<p>During the period immediately after the signing of the negotiated
peace which would be used by the Germans to consolidate
and strengthen their military position, we should probably be
allowed to retain our nominal sovereignty, although we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
not be able to do anything in the realm of foreign politics or
economics that was not permitted by Germany. During this period
our Lindberghs would declaim that they had been right after all
since we had not been invaded and we still elected our own president
and still sang “God Bless America,” and still called ourselves
the land of the free and home of the brave; and the Lindberghs
would insist that the sacrifices we had made were far better than
to have fought a war. But soon we should find that Hitler’s idea of
“equality” in South America meant complete Nazi monopoly. Soon
we should find we had lost all our world trade save that permitted
us by the Axis with the Axis on Axis terms.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Would the Nazi use of slave labor be an advantage? Can’t
free American labor always produce better and cheaper than slave
labor?</em></p>

<p>A. That is one of our popular fallacies. We proclaim this doctrine
at the same time that we use tariffs to protect American industry
from the products of foreign workers who receive lower wages
than American workers. Japanese manufactured articles, the cheapest
in the world because they are made by virtually slave labor,
were able to flood our market in spite of our high tariffs. For
ordinary mass production, for nearly every type of manufactured
article save quality goods, slave labor is more profitable than free
labor. If it is not so efficient, it makes up for that by being so
much cheaper. If Hitler were to get his slave Europe organized, he
could turn out products which would undersell anything we
could make.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Wouldn’t he try to make us take his goods also?</em></p>

<p>A. He would. We are talking now of the alternative to our going
to war and defeating Hitler. We are visualizing the situation as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
would be after Hitler had won, and had made all of those arrangements
with the rest of the world which we have described, and
was now in process of adjusting his Empire to the United States,
or rather of adjusting the United States to his Empire. We are
discussing now how we would have to behave if we wished to
continue to be at peace with Hitler. We would of course have to
make some kind of trade agreement with him. What kind of trade
agreement do you think Hitler would propose? We can suppose
he would offer us the same kind of agreement he has concluded
with other states before they fell, or before they volunteered to
become his vassals&mdash;the sort of agreements he had with Jugoslavia,
or Greece, and with Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria.
These agreements provide that German goods may enter at lower
tariffs than the goods of other countries or that tariffs on German
goods are abolished altogether, and usually the country concerned
must promise to take a minimum quantity of whatever articles
Germany wishes to export. If we hoped to have any kind of trade
agreement with the victorious Germans at all, it would have to be
one like this. We should probably have to consent to receive German
goods in such quantities and at such prices that our own
industry would step by step be ruined. This would be the German
aim. They intend to make German industry not only the only
industry in Europe, but the master of the manufacturing world.
They intend to wreck any industry they cannot control.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But you don’t think we would put up with such treatment as
that, do you? It would be better to go to war, wouldn’t it?</em></p>

<p>A. By that time it might be too late to go to war. Now is the
time to go to war. Now is the time to avoid those calamities we
have just discussed. If we had done nothing to protect ourselves
while we still had the power to protect ourselves and still had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
strong allies fighting in the field, what use would there be to try
to resist Hitler after he had become master of the world outside
America? We should then face the alternative of submission to
Hitler or fighting an almost hopeless war.</p>

<p>Our isolationists like the Quislings and the Darlans and Lavals
abroad, are working themselves into the position of the French
collaborationists. That is, they are going so far out on the limb
of isolation-appeasement that eventually they will not be able
to withdraw. Even today they refuse to admit their error. If the
worst came to the worst and we remained out of the war, and
Hitler won, and all these things we are discussing came to pass,
our isolationists would be bound to continue to contend that they
were right, and they would have to advocate collaboration with
Hitler, as indeed many of them do now. We can see what collaboration
means in France. Ninety-five per cent of the French
people are against it, and five per cent who advocate and practice
it are now considered traitors. This would be the history of our
isolationists also. When the alternative, war or surrender, was
offered, their answer would be that war was hopeless, and the only
sensible thing to do would be to collaborate with Hitler.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But isn’t there another way out for us? Couldn’t we simply
give up our foreign trade? In 1939 it amounted to only about six
billion dollars. What is that compared with the monstrous expense
of war? It is only one-seventh of the amount we have already
agreed to spend for defense. It is only one-tenth of our national
income.</em></p>

<p>A. Even if our total foreign trade represented only one-tenth of
our total business activity, that would make it vitally important,
for as you know, in an economy such as ours, ten per cent means
all the difference between failure and success. Hitler said of Germany,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
“we must export or die.” Our case is not that desperate,
but it would be fair to say we must export or suffer a lower
standard of living and increased unemployment. Witness the effect
on this country of our war export business which has revitalized
the entire economic system and practically wiped out unemployment.
Before long the last of our unemployed ought to be at work,
as they have all found jobs in England. Of course if we wished
to crawl into a completely abject isolation, we could give up our
foreign trade, recall our ships from the seven seas, seal our ports,
and retire into a kind of hillbilly life, eating our corn bread and
sowbelly, drinking our home-brew, and supporting a permanent
mass of millions of unemployed.</p>

<p>Even if we attempted such a thing we would not be permitted
to continue to live peacefully behind our imagined walls. The
world wants what we can produce. Nazi Germany wants it. If we
were to carry the isolationist argument to its final absurdity and
really try to set up a complete autarchy and live within the continental
borders of the United States, the Nazis would never let us
do so. From within and from without the Nazis would attack us.
Our own Nazis would labor to bring us into Hitler’s New Order,
while the German Nazis would assume the role of our own Commodore
Perry and as he broke open the Japanese closed door in
1854 the Nazis would smash the locks of American isolation.</p>

<p>We are discussing what would be a comparatively short period
of time, the period between the end of the war with a Hitler-negotiated
peace and the moment when he felt himself strong
enough to resume the war, this time to conquer all that was left
unconquered at the first truce. As soon as he had his machine in
order and perceived that his strength had risen relative to ours to
such a point that he considered victory certain, he, with Japan,
would attack Britain, then America. If we had agreed to any such
negotiated peace such as the one we have been discussing, we
would be lost. Britain and America have held out so far because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
despite the importance of air power, sea power is still paramount
and we have had sea power. We would not have it after a negotiated
peace.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But aren’t these terms of a negotiated peace somewhat dated
now since the German attack on Russia? Hasn’t the unexpectedly
strong Russian resistance diminished Hitler’s feeling that he can
already dictate as a victor?</em></p>

<p>A. No doubt Hitler’s arrogance has been reduced at least a little
since the “scum of the earth” checked his warriors, but the Russian
setback to Hitler has been only that, and it has not yet changed
his long-range plans. He still aspires to conquer the world and
he still believes he can do it, and any negotiated peace he may
offer, whether it is the one whose terms we have just discussed,
or some other terms more fitted to the moment, will be calculated
to give the Germans a respite in preparation for resumption of the
war. That, after all, is the important point to remember. Specific
terms are at this juncture unimportant. It is only essential to remember
that <em>any</em> negotiated peace with Hitler would not be a
peace at all, but only a truce to which Hitler would never agree
unless he believed he would thereby be strengthened for renewal
of the war. We can never emphasize too much that there is no
such thing as a peace with Hitler; there is no such thing as a peaceful
Hitler; Hitler will either conquer or be conquered.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But if Britain and the United States had agreed to the sort of
negotiated peace offered through Tokyo, they would have surrendered
practically everything, so why should Hitler go to the
trouble of attacking us?</em></p>

<p>A. Because Hitler does not want “practically” everything; he
wants absolutely everything. Also Hitler cannot stop making war;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
it will take a greater Nazi than he to convert the German war
machine to garrison duties and the Nazi hordes to peaceful production.</p>

<p>No conqueror ever stops conquering until he is stopped by some
outside force. Alexander was just getting into his stride and longing
for more worlds to conquer when he died of a fever after
drinking too much. Hitler will never be stopped that way. Caesar
was stopped by the assassin’s dagger. That could stop Hitler but it
would be foolish to depend upon it. Napoleon was stopped at
Waterloo by superior force. That we hope will be Hitler’s end.
But never did a conqueror stop as our Lindberghs believe Hitler
would stop, of his own accord, satisfied with what he had won.
Far more true is the analysis by my old friend Douglas Miller, who
during his fifteen years as United States Commercial Attaché in
Berlin was the constant source of knowledge about the Nazis for
all of us American newspapermen, and who now has written the
wisest book about the Nazis to appear from the pen of an American,
<cite>You Can’t Do Business with Hitler</cite>.</p>

<p>Miller puts the matter with hair-fine accuracy thus: “The essential
sterility of the Fascist system is one explanation of its aggressiveness.
The totalitarians are a group of bandits who have learned
no useful trade or occupation but are well armed and have no
scruples about attacking their neighbors. Germany has, under Hitler,
thrown away her possibilities of peaceful trade and understanding
with all the world and has no option but to go forward in the
campaign of aggression. She must not, in Hitler’s words, ‘export or
die’; she must fight or die. Under these circumstances it is completely
useless to await any peaceful settlement of Europe’s
troubles. The Nazis are not organized for peace. They are not
prepared for it. They would not know what to do with it.”</p>

<p>But beyond these reasons for attacking Britain and America even
after they had accepted such humiliating, emasculating terms as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
those we have sketched, Hitler would have the same reason to
attack the Anglo-American combination that he had to attack
Russia. He attacked Russia partly to remove the remote possibility
of a Russian attack while he was attempting to invade England,
but he attacked Russia also to get complete control over the Russian
resources which Stalin was doling out to him too slowly and
meagerly. So it would be with the resources of the rump British
Empire and of the United States. Hitler would not be satisfied
with the necessity for negotiating or trading with Anglo-America.
He would demand the power to dictate. So in the long run Hitler
by achieving such a negotiated peace as is advocated by Wheeler,
Nye, Lindbergh, and others, would have conquered America.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What kind of a peace would we make if we win the war?</em></p>

<p>A. That is more difficult to forecast than to sketch the outlines of
a Hitler world. His peace is engraved in his past and blueprinted
in his program. We know what it is like, a simple pattern of
masters and slaves. All we can say positively about our postwar
world is that the British and Americans and the populations of
Hitler’s conquered territory, wish it to be a world in which there
shall be no masters or slaves; we want justice for everybody, and
all the liberty possible, and we want to get rid of fear and want.
We know we will not be able to get all this but the difference
between us and Hitler is that Hitler does not even want such a
world. If he could have such a world by merely asking for it, he
would prefer to battle for his sort of world, because violent struggle
and the infliction of pain upon others is an essential part of
the satisfactions of the Nazis.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What chance has Communism in a defeated Germany?</em></p>

<p>A. If Hitler is defeated it is possible that the Communists will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
the strongest party or political group of any kind in Germany.
When he came to power Hitler dissolved all parties, and only the
Communists continued a militant, underground organization. The
bourgeois, democratic parties completely disappeared, and it is
hard to imagine their revival. It is easy to imagine the revival of
the Communist Party. It won six million votes at the last honest
election before Hitler seized the government. A great many Germans
who voted Communist entered the Nazi Party or Nazi organizations
such as the SA Brownshirts and the SS Elite Guards.
This confirmed the observation that between Nazism and Communism
as systems there existed more similarity than difference. It
would be easy for those who had been Communists before Hitler
came to power to return to the Communist cause after Hitler fell.
A Communist program promising immediate peace for the German
people and vengeance on the Nazi leaders would appeal more and
more to the masses of German workingmen as the war lengthens
and shows no signs of ending. We should not forget that the
Soviet government, or rather Joseph Stalin, unless he capitulates,
will have something to say when the time comes to think about
the kind of government Germany is to have.</p>


<p><em>Q. Well then, it seems to me that the first problem of our Peace
Conference will be what to do with the Germans.</em></p>

<p>A. It is likely that an even more urgent problem, demanding the
first attention of the Peace Conference, will be how to keep millions
of people in Europe from starving to death; how to restore
the railroad lines and other means of transportation; and how to
prevent sheer anarchy, or gutter-communism from seizing the continent.
In the period immediately after the Nazis collapse&mdash;and be
sure of one thing, and that is that when Hitler cracks he and his
regime will crack all at once in one frightful cataclysmic smash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
beside which the German surrender in the last war will look like
a fight to the finish&mdash;the likelihood is that throughout Europe law
and order will disappear for a time at least until Allied troops
arrive. For years the only law and order will have been the German
troops and Gestapo. The former leading citizens of the occupied
territories, Norwegian, Dutch, Czech, French, etc., will all
have been either killed, exiled, or demoralized. There will be no
firm group of strong men left to restore order anywhere in Europe.
In Germany itself the disorder will reach its height as the Nazi
masters flee and the German people take vengeance upon them.
There will be throughout the continent a universal struggle, as of
beasts, for the scanty food left. It is possible that more lives will
be lost in the immediate postwar period than in the war itself.
Therefore I say the most urgent problem before the Peace Conference
will be how to give Europe the physical means and the
police force to keep it alive.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>That is such a horrible picture that in spite of myself I must
ask if it would not be better to let Hitler have his way?</em></p>

<p>A. It is natural for us to recoil from such horrors. But let us remember
that whereas the agony of Europe and of the world,
brought about by the struggle to expel Hitler from power, will be
severe but brief, the degradation of all mankind which would result
from the failure to expel Hitler, would last perhaps for generations,
certainly far beyond the length of time it would take to restore
order in a Europe purged of the Nazis. What did it cost to achieve
liberty in the first place? Think of all the wars it has taken to enable
each of us to stand up and say, “I am the equal of any man on
earth.” If we are not able to face the prospect of fighting and
suffering and starving and dying for liberty and if we are not
confident enough in the righteousness of our cause to demand, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
request but demand, that our fellow citizens do likewise, then we
do not deserve liberty, we deserve our place with the rest of
Hitler’s slaves. Better that half the generation of men alive today
go down to early death than that Hitler should enslave all mankind.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Very well, I agree, but isn’t it understandable that we, away
over here in America, should shrink from such a future?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, but unless we learn not to shrink we shall surely die as a
nation. How many Americans today understand and fully realize,
emotionally as well as intellectually, that in order to retain our
liberty and our national independence and make secure the lives
of our children, we have to face now the prospect of years of war,
hardship, and the loss of many American lives, and the wounding
and maiming of many more? Certainly it is brutal, not my words,
but the reality. It is unworthy of a nation of 130,000,000 for its
leaders to suggest that all will be well if only we pass this piece of
legislation or take that stand or appropriate another trillion dollars.
Nothing will save this country except our own blood and our own
tears. And please do not go away and say that I “blithely” recommended
blood and tears. I bitterly declare there is no alternative.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>After we have been able, as we hope, to install temporary law
and order and emergency rations throughout the continent, isn’t
the problem of Germany next on the agenda of the Peace Conference?</em></p>

<p>A. It must be. There is a still larger, the largest problem, that of
trying to reorganize the world into a scheme for living without
war, for some kind of Federated Humanity, but for us in the
Western World nothing can be done until we discover what to
do with Germany. Here is a nation of 80,000,000 whose leaders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
clamoring for “living space,” shamelessly declare they intend to
multiply into 250,000,000 within a century and use their superior
force to exterminate or enslave everybody else. Here is a nation
which thrice in the memory of living man, in 1870, 1914, and 1939
has launched its war machine against its neighbors, taken the lives
of millions, and now has disrupted the civilization of the entire
world. Here is a nation, distinguished in its past history by precious
contributions to the arts and sciences, which today, led by the lust
for conquest, has discarded Christ, truth, justice, and has debased
a whole generation of its youth to the moral and ethical level of
savages.</p>

<p>Here is a nation which is one of the most talented on earth in
the theory and practice of the natural sciences, capable of world
leadership in bending nature to the peaceful services of mankind,
to the amelioration of suffering and the increase of prosperity, and
what does this nation do? It devotes all its talents to the cultivation
of the science of warfare, and becomes adept beyond all other
nations in the arts of destruction. Why? What is behind all this
evil? Never in modern history has any nation in the Western
World displayed such incorrigible tendencies to raid, rob, seize,
invade, plunder, conquer, and torture. Torture! For the deepest
blot upon Nazi Germany is its dark love of torture, its base delight
in pain endured by others, its cruel concentration camps. Never
in any quarter of the globe at any time in mankind’s history has
any nation revealed so determined a will and clever a method to
exploit permanently as slaves the unfortunate victims of its martial
skill. The problem then is, how to restrain Germany, or how to
reform Germany, how, if possible, to bring her into our world
family.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why not say the problem is how to destroy her or at least
paralyze her?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span></p>

<p>A. For several reasons. First, because it is impracticable to destroy
80,000,000 persons even if we were Nazi enough to wish to do so.
You can be sure that if Hitler as head of a non-German Alliance
were faced with the German problem he would solve it precisely
that way, by extermination of the Germans. But we are not Nazis,
and even suppose some on our side were to advocate destruction
of the Germans by mass emasculation, you can be sure that millions
of Americans and Britons would arise and cry out in defense of
the poor German people, misguided victims, innocent souls. Politically
and morally this solution is out of the question.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is there no way we could render Germany impotent to do
harm, no way we could deprive her of the possibility of attacking
the world again?</em></p>

<p>A. There are two ways: military occupation or deindustrialization
of the Reich. It is plain that if Germany is allowed the least opportunity,
she would rearm and attack with the same swift ferocity
she has just displayed. There must be physical restraint to keep
her from doing so. Military occupation is the obvious, traditional
method, but it has serious drawbacks. It is expensive and tiring.
Nevertheless if the Nazis are defeated in this war, it will be imperative
to occupy Germany far more thoroughly than after the last
war, if only to preserve order. There are some advocates of
deliberately allowing Germany a period of disorder during which
it could be hoped that the Germans would themselves exterminate
a great number of Nazis. This would only render more formidable
the task which already appears staggeringly difficult, to re-establish
a state of law in the Reich, where since 1933, law as we know it,
has been abolished. Whatever permanent system of controlling
Germany is eventually adopted, the first step will have to be military
occupation. Theoretically, military occupation could be continued
indefinitely. Actually it never is continued long, because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
occupying troops and their people at home grow tired of it. Even
the French, who directly after the war were fanatically determined
to secure their frontier by taking the Rhineland, and who did get
in the Treaty of Versailles permission to occupy the Rhineland for
fifteen years, even these prudent and wary French grew so tired
of it that they evacuated the Rhineland three years ahead of time,
in June 1930.</p>

<p>Six years later the Nazis moved in and constructed the Siegfried
line along the very positions which had been occupied by the
French troops. I know there were other reasons for the French to
give up the Rhineland. The British had pressed them to appease
the Germans. The Germans had agreed in the Young Plan to a
new system of reparations and as reward received the Rhineland
ahead of schedule. But the moment the last French troops left
Germany the period of fulfillment of the war treaties came to an
end, and Germany began the period of repudiation and revision
which ended in this war and for France in her present national
humiliation. Looking backward one can see that nothing should
have moved the French to leave the Rhineland. That they did so
is a classic example of how people grow so careless, lazy, forgetful
and peace-minded that they become insensible to a threat to their
very lives. That is the state of mind of America today.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You mentioned a second possibility for physically retraining
Germany and you used the word deindustrialization. What does
that mean?</em></p>

<p>A. It is an ugly word but I know no other to describe the process
of taking away a country’s factories and leaving it without industry.
That of course would also leave it without the means of making
war. This is what Germany plans to do to the rest of Europe, as
we have seen. The civilized world would have every right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
impose the same treatment on the inventor of the scheme. Briefly
the plan would be to occupy Germany militarily; to disarm her
rigorously; to dismantle all her factories capable of making instruments
of war; to prohibit the import into Germany of raw materials
which could be used for making such instruments; to confiscate
and turn over to Allied ownership and operation all German mines
producing iron or other metals; and to appoint a permanent Inter-allied
Control Commission to supervise these restrictions. It would
be necessary to forbid all manufacture or use of airplanes by Germans
in Germany.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How does this proposal fit in with the fourth paragraph of the
eight-point Atlantic Charter which reads, “They will endeavor,
with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment
by all states, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access,
on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world
which are needed for their economic prosperity.”</em></p>

<p>A. There is the difficulty. Adherence to this paragraph would prevent
any such solution as deindustrialization, because there could
be no economic prosperity for a deindustrialized Germany. The
first effect of it would be a widespread return to the land, as Germans
would have no manufactured articles for export, and hence
nothing with which to buy abroad, and hence would be forced to
grow all their own food. The population would decline, young
folks would emigrate if any country would take them, and in general
it would be a very unhappy period for the Herrenvolk. Apparently
Roosevelt and Churchill have rejected this solution in
favor of simple old-fashioned military occupation.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>They said nothing in their statement about militarily occupying
Germany.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span></p>

<p>A. No, but they said plainly they intended to disarm the aggressor
nations. You do not suppose you could disarm Germany without
occupying her, do you? It ought to be possible to devise something
more effective and novel than the thousand-year-old method of
sending in troops. One suggestion is that all German officers (there
may be around 500,000 of them) should be exiled to an island under
perpetual guard where they could make their own living and
end their lives in contemplation of their sins. The German Army
would be abolished entirely; not as in 1919 reduced to 100,000 men
who were to become the cadre of the present seven-million-man
machine. For a decade or more the Allies would have to accept the
responsibility of policing Germany. All military manuals and textbooks
would be destroyed. Aviation of all kinds and the building
of airplanes would likewise be forbidden. These measures would
be for the purpose of demilitarizing the population, and it is possible
that, deprived of military instructors or any means of military
instruction, the plan might work, as least for a time.</p>

<p>In any plan dealing with postwar Germany it is important to
avoid vindictiveness. Nothing should be done as a punishment of
Germany’s crimes in the past; everything should be done to restrain
her from crime in the future. How much better it would have been
if there had been no reparations imposed upon Germany after the
last war, but the Allies had kept their Military Control Commission
permanently in Germany while Allied troops permanently
occupied the Rhineland. There is no use, however, in hoping for
any such <em>permanent</em> resolution on our part. We have only one hope
of being able to restrain Germany for any considerable period, by
the humane means which are the only ones open to us.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What hope have we of being able to restrain Germany?</em></p>

<p>A. It is the hope that while we occupy Germany with our troops,
say for the next thirty or forty years, a new generation of Germans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
would grow up which would forego its desire to conquer
the world, forget that it was a Herrenvolk, and would gradually
learn the habits of civilization. Meanwhile we would try to develop
a World Federation or League of Nations under Anglo-American
leadership to such a point of effectiveness that we could afford to
allow Germany to become a member of it.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But do you suppose our people or the British would put up
with the trouble and expense of occupying Germany militarily for
thirty or forty years? Wouldn’t there be an outcry on behalf of
the Germans?</em></p>

<p>A. Many of our people would probably try to sabotage any realistic
handling of the Germans. After the last war and at the beginning
of this one you could hear many Americans remarking: “How
could you expect the Germans or any upstanding, self-respecting
people to tolerate being treated unequally, to put up with being
disarmed while their neighbors were armed?” These remarks disclosed
misapprehension of the German mind which will surely be
duplicated at the end of this war by similar persons. That will not
matter so much since the British will have a great deal to say about
how the Germans are to be restrained, and this time the British
will not be as shortsighted as they were after the last war.</p>

<p>You may remember that the French in 1919 wanted to occupy
permanently various strategic points in Germany, including the
Rhineland, but the British said no. They had two principal reasons
for not consenting to proper restraint of the Germans and both
reasons were, as we can see from our perspective of today, completely
invalid. First, they did not want France to become too
strong; they believed they had to maintain a balance of power
with Germany, apparently leaving out of account the enormous,
patent facts that there were 80,000,000 Germans to 40,000,000
Frenchmen, that the French birth rate was nearing the point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
racial suicide, that Frenchmen were concerned not at all with expansion
but only to keep what they had in their beloved “security.”
Second, the British people had failed during the war to suffer any
of the pain and tribulation the Germans had visited upon the
French, who had seen their towns and villages destroyed, their
families blown to bits by German artillery.</p>

<p>Today when the British sit down to a Peace Table they will be
a different people. In Britain today are upward of 44,000,000 persons
who have been under bombardment for two years and have
suffered a strain upon their courage such as has no parallel. They
have witnessed the mutilation of their dear ones, the destruction
of their monuments. They have heard the menace from their enemy
that he intended to destroy England as Carthage was destroyed.
Is it likely that when the British sit down victorious in a Peace
Conference they will shrink from the application of methods, no
matter how severe, to prevent the recurrence of this horror? We
shall not earn the right to speak at all at the Peace Conference until
we have borne our share of the heat of the day. I hope we shall
not try to exercise our influence to obstruct whatever solutions
may seem appropriate at the end of years of war, to solve this
essentially insoluble problem of the Germans.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why do you call the German problem insoluble?</em></p>

<p>A. Because no matter what we do, short of destroying the Germans,
which we have agreed is impossible, the Germans are likely
to break out again on the warpath some time. Let us assume that
we take the view that the Versailles treaty was too harsh, and this
time we will avoid all the mistakes of harshness. We grant Germany
a peace treaty which not only takes nothing from her, but
allows her to retain a considerable quantity of the territorial spoils
she has accumulated by violence. We agree to let her retain all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
territory inhabited for the most part by German-speaking people.
Thus she is allowed to keep Western Poland whence she has so
brutally expelled the native Polish population. She is allowed to
keep the German Sudetenland, formerly Czechoslovakian, and
until the men of Munich gave it to Hitler, never before a part of
Germany. She is allowed to keep Belgian Eupen Malmedy; and
even any part of Lorraine which may desire to opt for Germany.
She is allowed to keep Austria. In short, Germany is allowed to
keep all her 80,000,000 Germans together. More than that, in
order to “right every wrong,” Germany is given back her old
colonies, all of them. Thus there is no thought of dividing the
country. There are of course no reparations. There are no punitive
measures of any kind. Germany is invited to join the new World
Federation as soon as it has been formed. Certainly this sort of
treatment ought to mollify any people. This ought to be a perfect
peace. But wait, there is a crucial point. Shall Germany be allowed
now, at once, to bear arms again? Or ever again? And how many
arms? What kind?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Haven’t Churchill and Roosevelt already declared the aggressors
would be disarmed?</em></p>

<p>A. Very well, the victors will insist that Germany is to have no
arms at least for a period of years. Do you think that then the
Germans, even with a treaty such as we have sketched, granting
every conceivable amelioration, would be satisfied? No. If we restricted
their armed forces in any degree, for example, by depriving
them of offensive weapons, of tanks and bombing planes, you
can be sure that the complaint of the Germans would be as great
as though they had been stripped of half their population, the
Reich divided into a score of puppet states, and their cities occupied
by divisions of Senegalese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Aren’t the Germans merely demanding absolute, uncompromising
equality?</em></p>

<p>A. They always demand absolute, uncompromising superiority.
Look back on Hitler’s reign. He had several chances to stop this
side of war, after having gained for his people not mere equality
with his greatest rival, France, and not mere equality with the
political and military forces of all his neighbors put together, but
with real superiority in arms and in political power over all Europe.
Look at the chances he had to stop short of war and build in peace,
and perhaps go down as a greater man than he will appear after
this bloody debacle is over. He could have stopped after he got
the Sudetenland, and had finally united nearly all of his 80,000,000
Germans. He could have stopped after he took Austria; after he
occupied the Rhineland; after he got the Saar back into Germany.
The taking of the Sudetenland would have been a place to stop at
the pinnacle. Suppose he had done that, and had used his power
and talent to transfer his war machine into a peace machine, and
had used his mighty prestige to bring Europe into a new economic
order. Germany had attained practical “equality” with France by
1936 when Hitler’s troops entered the Rhineland, and they had
“equality” with all the rest of Europe put together&mdash;as Hitler has
now so disastrously proved&mdash;by 1938 when they got the Sudetenland.
So the point is that the Germans never wanted equality, will
never be satisfied with equality, but will always demand to be
what they believe themselves to be, namely, the <em>master</em> race.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Aren’t you confusing the Germans with Hitler and the Nazis?</em></p>

<p>A. No, the Germans have done that themselves. By their so-called
plebiscites which document their uniformly spineless behavior since
Hitler came to power, they have identified themselves with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
and permitted him uncontradicted to define himself as Deutschland.</p>

<p>There is just a chance that a combination of generosity and
firmness may impress a minority of Germans which may grow and
eventually bring the whole nation into our hoped-for World Federation.
If, on the contrary, the Germans secretly arm, and prepare
another ambush for civilization, our only hope is to find it
out in time. We should have no hope at all if our sobbing societies
succeeded in inducing the Peace Conference to give the Germans
equality in arms. Let us remember that if we were all to disarm,
including Germany, it would be just as disadvantageous for us as
if we remained armed and allowed Germany to keep equal arms.
For at any stage of armament or disarmament the Germans are
superior to almost any combination of their opponents. Germany is
not just another nation. It is a nation, not exceptionally numerous,
but so highly talented in the mechanics, chemistry, and physics of
warfare and so professionally skilled in the staff work of war, and
so obediently brave in the practice of battle, that its military power
is greater than that of any other single nation on earth, with no
exceptions.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What are we going to do with all the former nations of Europe,
especially the fifteen or so which were conquered? Are we going
to reconstitute them all as they were?</em></p>

<p>A. We shall try to reconstitute all those which are capable of
maintaining a national life, but how can one foresee the fate of
such unfortunate little states as Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania?
The Soviet government, through its ambassador to London, Mr.
Maisky, now declares that it approves the Atlantic Charter’s Eight
Points, including the right of self-determination of all nations. This
has been hailed as a great step forward; but I should prefer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
wait to see the Red Army evacuate voluntarily any territory it
may hold at the end of this war.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Soviet government toward the rights of
small nations is brilliantly illustrated by Stalin’s treatment of the
Baltic States. First, he asked Britain and France for them to be
handed him on a platter, as roast chicken. Having been refused,
he waited until the war began, then forcibly occupied the three
little states, which were among the more attractive and in many
ways more admirable little countries in Europe. We have almost
completely overlooked the grisly fate of the middle-class population
of the Baltic states&mdash;virtually exterminated by Stalin’s gunmen
in one of those side shows of horror which only the great war
could obscure. The Baltic population is suffering an epic of agony.
After Stalin’s G.P.U. had killed or exiled all the professional and
business people and all those suspected of being Nazi sympathizers,
and then after war had swept the three countries, the Germans
and the Gestapo moved in and killed all the Communist and
other labor leaders and anti-Nazis. Now that Stalin has been driven
out of the Baltic states, and they are occupied by the Nazis, the
Soviet policy is ceremoniously announced to be in favor of restoration
of full national independence to all states.</p>

<p>That must ring bitterly in the ears of the pitiful remnant of the
population of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Is there enough of
them left to make it possible to resuscitate their nations? The experience
of these countries shows how difficult it will be in our
postwar settlement to give national independence to small states
and at the same time allow them the possibility of national security.
Many a small state will have to choose between the one or the
other. If it stands alone, it may be devoured by a larger neighbor.
If it enters a larger unit, it will have to sacrifice some of its sovereignty.
All this points to the necessity of making the larger unit
big enough to comprise all nations.</p>

<p>Whatever we do, the Soviet Union will present us with almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
as many problems as Germany. How can Britain and the United
States confidently outline specific war aims as long as we do not
know what the position of the Soviet Union will be at the end of
this war? And if the Soviet Union survives in her present form
and temper, and has not defected from the war, how is she to fit
into our world peace organization? There are in it only two durable
points of reference: the United States and Great Britain, and
one great hope of success for the organization of peace, the firm
friendship of the two countries, braced by their control of the
seas. Our only chance of realizing such a peace is by cherishing
between ourselves a mutual trust which will override our selfish
ambitions, for there are many points and places on the globe where
our material interests conflict. We cannot maintain this relationship
until we Americans begin to carry our full share of the burden
of the war and the British in turn make us feel we are welcome to
the comradeship as well as the responsibilities of the war and the
peace.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do the British want such a Pax Anglo-Americana which would
divide their victory with us?</em></p>

<p>A. Let us not be sentimental about the British in spite of our partnership
and friendship with them. The British would like nothing
on earth so much as to be able to win this war without the United
States’ help. They would dearly love to win alone and enjoy the
fruits of victory alone. But they know now they cannot win alone.
They know they cannot beat the Germans without our full, shooting
participation in the war. And so they are resigned to accepting
our companionship in battle.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>“Resigned to accepting our companionship in battle”? Is that
the way the British feel? Well, then, I for my part....</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span></p>

<p>A. Yes, I know what you are going to say: that you for your
part would just as soon not help the British if that’s the way they
feel about it. How many Americans there are left who still think
in terms of “helping the British”! Cannot we finally understand
that we are helping first of all ourselves, and that it would make
no difference to us if the British were not human beings at all, but
a race of perspicacious, pugnacious penguins?</p>

<p>So long as these penguins are fighting off our common enemy
who would attack us if the penguins fell, is it not just good sense to
throw our whole combat aid to the penguins, no matter what the
penguins may think of us? If the British were to have a mental
breakdown and declare they disliked us so thoroughly that they
would accept no more help from us of any kind and would rather
be beaten by the Nazis than win with American help, we should be
compelled from our own vital self-interest to beg to be allowed to
help them and then we should have to urge and even threaten until
reluctantly the British made room for us in the battle line. It is
good luck that the British are people who would be worth saving
even if thereby we were not going to save ourselves.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Will you recapitulate how you visualize the organization of
peace?</em></p>

<p>A. First, a Pax Anglo-Americana, based on our naval control of
the world. This may take one of several forms, including Union
Now, Clarence Streit’s thoughtful plan for amalgamating the
democracies. Its immediate purpose would be to unite the coercive
power of the nations of good will to restrain those of ill will until
time and repentance had made it possible to bring them into our
second organization. This World Federation of some kind might
be a resuscitated League of Nations, or it might have another name
or form. All we know positively is that unless we organize for
peace, we shall have war again; and we know now that the nations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
of good will on earth are not strong enough without the United
States to impose peace on the world. We know that if we stay out
of the peace we shall surely be drawn into the succeeding war.
Perhaps by the end of this present struggle we shall have learned
our lesson and will never again attempt to withdraw into an illusory
isolation which must always bring us into the very war it tried
to avoid. Perhaps for the first time in our history we will with
open eyes and clear plan enter the strength of the United States
into the organization of peace with the same zeal we use to make
war. If we do, who knows but that the peace established after this
war could endure for longer than we even dare to guess at this
melancholy moment.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is it a fact that because of the war England is becoming Socialist
and will come out of the war with a government and social
system just as repugnant to us as the Nazis’?</em></p>

<p>A. It is true that the government and social system of England
have become Socialist but in the Christian and democratic sense
of the word. British society has become a Christian collective. If
they could maintain after the war as ideal a spirit of cooperation
and love of their neighbors as they have today under fire, we might
call it the first step toward the millennium. Far from being a government
and social system we disapproved, they would be worthy
of our emulation. To compare such a system of voluntary, democratic,
unselfish devotion to the common good as exists today in
wartime England with the Nazi regime is to compare good with
evil. Beaten by the blows of war the British people have attained
in a period of months a degree of social progress they would not
have reached in decades otherwise.</p>

<p>Britain was forced to adopt a system of wartime socialism, if
you want to call it that, because that form of socialism under the
inspiration of life-and-death battle can produce so much more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
uncontrolled capitalism. Production is the materialist index of the
value of any economic system. Under British wartime socialism,
capitalists and workers genuinely pool their interests and restrict
their demands to the minimum, while men and women of all classes
risk and give their lives in battle for the community. Until we
adopt such a system and are inspired by the same dire necessity
which animates the British, our system of production, man for
man, and unit for unit, will not equal British production. As for
the Nazis, their system of Socialism, based on Terror and megalomania,
aims to enslave the world; the British system of Socialism,
based on free choice and democracy, aims to liberate the world.
No, there is no possibility that any form of government should
emerge in England after the war which would be “as repugnant
to us as the Nazis’,” unless Britain is conquered and becomes a
satrapy of Hitler.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is this British wartime Socialism not really equivalent to Communism?
How does it differ from capitalism?</em></p>

<p>A. It is the sort of communism anyone would approve if it could
work in peacetime, though it seems that it really works only in
war. In wartime the motive that makes men work is defense of
their lives, their families, their nation, against an enemy from without.
This leads to a degree of self-sacrifice that is never even
approximated in peacetime. Witness the invariable collapse of
national morale after every war. One of the chief reasons, if not
the chief reason, why communism in peacetime does not work,
either in Russia or anywhere else, is because except under the duress
of war, individuals primarily work for themselves. The Russian
Bolshevik party tried for twenty-three years to make the Russians
work for the community, but they never succeeded until now,
when they have gone to war. No matter how the Battle of Russia
turns out, when the war is over, if the Soviet Union is still Communist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
it will revert to its accustomed slackness and poverty. If
the British were to try to continue their wartime socialism into
peacetime, they would find it impossible. Strikes would break out;
employers would begin to reach out for profits and soon the old-time,
though modified capitalism would return, with many of its
faults, but still far more productive than peacetime communism
anywhere in the world. Capitalism in peace; collectivism in war
appears to be the law for democracies in our time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">5. FRANCE</h2>
</div>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why did France fall?</em></p>

<p>A. Because the French people were hypnotized by their low birth
rate; because their Maginot line had imprisoned their army; because,
ignorant of the character and intentions of their enemy, they did
not know why they had to fight the Germans and so preferred to
fight among themselves; because they had no Churchill; because
they were betrayed by a powerful group of their leaders including
senior officers of the Army; and because the French were stultified
by their debased and venal press.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But I thought they lost chiefly because they lacked the proper
weapons: airplanes and tanks.</em></p>

<p>A. They did not possess anything like the number of tanks and
airplanes used by the Germans; but I would rank this deficiency at
the bottom of any list of causes of the French defeat. If they had
ignored their birth rate, been willing to spend lives, had retained
the old offensive spirit traditional in the French Army, had known
that they had to win or perish, had possessed a Churchill to inspire
and lead them, and had had no traitors in their ranks, their comparative
lack of weapons would not have mattered; they would still be
fighting the Germans in France. The inferiority of their equipment
consisted, as you indicate, in the lack of a sufficient number of
planes and tanks, but if they had had the spirit to win they could
have held the Germans until the deficiency could be made up.</p>

<p>Tanks cannot cross properly defended rivers, and there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
several sets of rivers which the French could have held if they
chose: the Meuse, the Somme and the Oise, the Aisne, the Marne,
the Seine, and finally the Loire, but they held not at all at any of
these natural barriers. At most of these rivers I was present during
the retreat, and it astonished all of us, including United States officers,
to visit a French position along a river one day and observe
how strong it was, and how difficult it would be to take, and then
the next day learn the Germans had taken it within a few hours of
our departure.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But surely the reason was the German dive bombers who could
fly across the rivers and drive the defenders away. I have heard that
they were the principal weapon used to break the French who
didn’t have enough pursuit planes to down them. It seems to me that
if the dive bomber is anything like as lethal as it is said to be, you
must put more of the blame for the French collapse on it than on
the failure of French morale.</em></p>

<p>A. No, the dive bombers are not effective against brave determined
troops. They are not as effective as artillery. I have an authority for
that, General Charles Huntziger, now Minister of War of the
Vichy government. I met him when he was Commander of the
Second Army occupying the left wing of the Maginot line. It was
about May 31, 1940 in the second week after the German break-through.</p>

<p>General Huntziger received me in his headquarters, an old fortress
of Verdun. He explained that he had now taught his men how
to meet the terrible German tank-plus-dive-bomber attack. He said
that he had explained to his men that the dive bomber was not
nearly so deadly as artillery, and that its effect was chiefly psychological,
and that if the soldiers could master their first fright they
could hold their ground and win. The great thing was to hold long
enough to learn that your chance of being killed by dive bombers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
was much less than your chance of being killed by artillery fire,
since artillery shells may fall uninterruptedly for an indefinite time,
while a dive bomber has only one or at the most a few bombs to
discharge, and once it has dropped them, has to return to its base
for more, and the number of dive bombers is limited.</p>

<p>He emphasized that French soldiers had never been afraid to
stand artillery fire, so why should they run from the less dangerous
dive bombers? He said he instructed all soldiers not serving antiaircraft
guns to go under cover for the few seconds while the
dive bombers dived, but to emerge immediately upon hearing the
detonation of the bombs, and meet the advancing tanks. If they
were small thinly armored tanks, and the French possessed adequate
antitank guns, they should attempt to destroy the tanks. If the
tanks were too large and heavily armored, the French should permit
the tanks to go through and emerge in time to stop the German
infantry following the tanks.</p>

<p>General Huntziger admitted that it had been extremely difficult
at first to persuade his troops of the comparative harmlessness of the
dive bombers and mentioned the fact that in the first thirteen days
of the German attack his troops had been overwhelmed and he had
lost fifty per cent of his effectives, more than ninety per cent of
whom were captured, but he believed that now the troops were experienced
and could not be frightened as they were at first. As we
were soon to observe, the French troops never did get used to the
dive bomber which is truly the most terrifying weapon ever invented.
General Huntziger compared it to a locomotive with its
whistle wide open falling upon you from the sky.</p>

<p>“You are certain it is coming just for you,” the General said,
“and you believe it is not merely going to drop bombs upon you,
but you are sure the plane itself is going to crash upon you and
leave you smashed like a beetle.”</p>

<p>The noise of the dive bomber is its most terrifying quality. An
ordinary airplane diving makes a loud rushing noise familiar to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
everyone nowadays, but many of the German dive bombers were
equipped with sirens attached to loud-speakers, so that when they
dived each plane screamed with the noise of a score of ordinary
diving planes. In addition to that they were often equipped with
screaming bombs. General Touchon, commander of the Sixth
Army, showed me one at his headquarters. It had four whistles,
each about the size of a cannon cracker, in the vanes of its tail.
They made each falling bomb sound as loud as four American locomotives
with the whistles open. “But,” General Huntziger said, “all
you have to do is to realize that noise doesn’t hurt anyone, and I
have explained that to my soldiers and from now on they will
stand firm.”</p>

<p>Huntziger gave me a copy of his orders of the day. I cannot
read it even now without feeling the terrible weight of despair that
settled upon all of us as we realized that the end of France was
near. It is dated May 18, 1940 and begins: “The war has commenced,”&mdash;it
was to be all over in exactly thirty days&mdash;“and, in
order to win, the enemy always attacks your morale. In this first
shock, his tactic, his ruses of warfare and his weapons have but one
object, <em>to demoralize you</em>. The enemy is reckoning only upon fighting
you with fright. It is necessary therefore that you know this.</p>

<p>“Know also that the massive bombardments of the enemy aviation,
no matter how impressive they are, make few victims, as you
may have already noted. You know the total lost; they are a minimum.
Take refuge when the enemy aircraft passes and immediately
afterward take up again your combat post. Never forget our aviation
protects you. <em>Even when you cannot see it.</em> Know that our airplanes
have knocked down more than a thousand enemy machines
in less than eight days and that among the enemy our bombers are
giving blow for blow.</p>

<p>“Know that against infantry the tank is not able to accomplish
big things if you hide yourself and the tanks cannot see you. Let
them pass without showing yourself, then fire on the guides who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
accompany them. Without them the tank is almost blind; sooner
or later it will have to abandon the field to refuel if our antitank
guns have not already knocked it out.</p>

<p>“These guns are very efficient; they have given many proofs of it
in the last few days.</p>

<p>“Do not allow yourself to be influenced by tales of parachutists
but if you actually find some, remember that an armed man can
always beat them. Guard yourself against imaginary dangers. As
though you were in active combat, you have to defend yourself
against false rumors which may be spread by a traitor or an imbecile
seized with panic.</p>

<p>“If you listen to such tales they may be able to provoke serious
defection. Listen to no one but your superior officers and those
you know.</p>

<p>“A man can overcome his fear. It is his duty to surmount it and
to combat the fears of others. If a man spreads fear he not only
commits an act of cowardice. He commits treason.</p>

<p>“Know finally that the enemy is not so strong as some people
think. Oppose to him your will. It is your will which will sweep
the enemy away. Never forget what you are defending. If you let
the enemy pass you will lose more than your life. You will be pitilessly
separated from your families to suffer far from them a slavery
worse than death.”</p>

<p>The intelligence and courage of Huntziger as displayed in these
orders were of no avail, because he could not, as Churchill can,
transmit his spirit to others. His soldiers listened to his talk and
read his orders of the day but still they yielded to their fear. It
must be seldom in military history that a commanding general has
to devote his principal orders to adjuring his troops not to be afraid.
The French Army was already panic-stricken.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You say there was treachery among senior officers of the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
Army and among the government. Why do you say that and what
proof of it have you?</em></p>

<p>A. There were both treachery and treason. High French officers
and officials conspired to overthrow the Republic. Pétain himself
was their leader. They were so fanatical in their desire to destroy
the Republic that they fell into the German trap and acquiesced in
what the Germans told them would be a fake defeat, after which
they would set up the Fascist government which they did set up at
Vichy. After that Hitler would withdraw his troops and restore
France to all her old power and glory, an equal partner and friend
of Nazi Germany. They were of course deceived and now most of
them must realize they were deceived, and that Hitler has no intention
of ever allowing France to be a great power again. But this
awakening is too late and the guilty men, many of them now in
Pétain’s government, have a life-and-death interest in preserving
their secret, since in the present temper of the French people if the
truth were known many another assassination would follow the
attempts on Laval and Deat.</p>

<p>This is a rough outline of what I believe to have happened in
France. I will be glad to give you all the evidence I have, admitting
that it probably is not sufficient to win a verdict of guilty in a court
of law, but maintaining that it is convincing to one who witnessed
the debacle and was bewildered by the lack of adequate explanation.
You see, after we had added up all the other reasons for the
fall of France, there was still something lacking; something to explain
the fact that the French Army of nearly five million men,
with its centuries of glorious tradition, and its reputation among
experts as the best in the world, never once held firm after the
Germans broke through the Low Countries, never once stopped
the enemy for as much as a day, but steadily, day by day retreated,
crumbled, broke up, and at the end of five weeks ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Review our list of causes now and see if all of them put together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
explain this phenomenon. Complacency and trust in the Maginot
line and the softening effect of eight months of inactivity, comparative
lack of leadership, man power and planes and tanks; lack of
faith, anger, and the spirit to fight to kill; conflict between communists
and conservatives. No, all these reasons together do not
explain the conduct of the French Army between May 11 and
June 17, 1940.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But the thesis you present is too astounding. That French Army
officers should have conspired with the enemy is almost beyond belief.
Do you mean the French General Staff?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, the French General Staff. Not all of it; only a few members
were necessary. If you find it difficult to believe, remember that
the French officers and officials concerned did not believe they
were betraying France; they believed that Hitler would keep his
word and restore France as soon as the Republic was overthrown.
To make this aspect of the matter clear: suppose you were a young
Frenchman today, would you think of it as treason if you worked
to overthrow the Vichy government? Would you think of yourself
as a traitor if you conspired with the British to throw out
Pétain and reorganize a democratic government? No.</p>

<p>Well, in so far as one can credit such Fascists with sincerity, we
have to admit that these men also thought they were serving the
best interests of France when they conspired to overthrow the
Republic. Remember that French officers as a class have generally
been anti-Republican. Napoleon’s officers soon forgot Republican
principles in their devotion to the Emperor. The hierarchy of the
Army did not favor the equalitarianism of the French Republic.
Aristocratic officers generally set the tone for the majority of the
higher ranks. Time and again I was astonished to note that upper-class
Frenchmen seemed to remember as though it had been yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
the bloody events of the French Revolution, and were more
afraid of their own working class than of any foreign enemy.</p>

<p>I visited once the famous deep cellar vaults of the Bank of France
where they kept the gold, and while walking through the doorway,
piercing its twenty-foot thick steel and concrete walls, I asked why
they needed such formidable and expensive protection. Was it
against the Germans? It could not be, because if ever the Germans
occupied Paris, as they do today, no underground fortification such
as these vaults could prevent them from getting the gold, especially
since the Germans would be holding as hostages the men with the
keys. No, it was not against a foreign enemy; the vaults were built
against the Paris mob, against revolutionaries, against another 1789.</p>

<p>This spirit was shared by many French senior officers, and it is
ironic that their conspiracy to bring about a feigned defeat in order
to overthrow the Republic was greatly helped by the defection of
the Parisian Communist troops in Corap’s Ninth Army at the
Meuse. The very workingmen who had most to lose by the fall
of the Republic and the establishment of a Fascist France, helped
bring about their own downfall under the mistaken guidance of
Moscow. The treachery to France came from the two opposite
poles of French society.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How did this treason manifest itself in the operations of the
army?</em></p>

<p>A. I will give you one example, from personal experience and the
testimony of French friends. You remember the Germans, when
they broke through the Low Countries and across the Meuse,
dashed with their Panzer divisions for the coast, pell-mell, at top
speed, not bothering or wasting time at first to widen their column
of penetration, which was still only a few miles wide for much of
its length when the first German detachments reached the sea at
Abbeville. North of this thin German column was the strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
French Army under General Prioux, while south of it were the
main French forces. It was the constant fervid hope of the French
that their armies would cut across the German column, roll it up
in two directions, and win not merely the battle of France but
perhaps the war.</p>

<p>Military experts, foremost our own, thought it possible; some
held it probable. This hope reached its climax after Weygand made
an inspection flight to the Low Countries and returned to Paris.
That day at the Ministry of Information as I was waiting in the
office for Colonel Schieffer, in charge of American correspondents,
the gaunt, one-eyed, black-monocled, fiercely patriotic Colonel
came in with a bang, dropped his customary stillness and exclaimed:
“Weygand says he won’t leave a German alive, not one. He’s going
to cut the column and bottle them up and he says there won’t be
left one living.” Like wildfire the word of Weygand spread
through the building, through Paris, through France. It was the
only bright moment in the whole Battle of France.</p>

<p>But it did not happen. Why didn’t it? A captain from General
Prioux’s staff may have the answer. This is the story he told. “After
the Germans reached Abbeville and cut us off from the South,
General Prioux called us all together one day and said, ‘I have orders
from General Headquarters that you must blow up your tanks and
guns and retreat as speedily as possible to the seashore. I must tell
you that personally I do not approve these orders. I am convinced
we are strong enough to make an offensive southward and cut the
Germans and reunite with our troops in France. However, orders
are orders and one does not discuss orders. You will do as I have
told you and I shall stay here where I am.’</p>

<p>“We did as we were told and Prioux became a prisoner of war.
That was our last chance. The failure to cut the German column
was the end of the Battle of France. We could have done it; we
were ordered not to.”</p>

<p>Counterattack, always we waited for the famous French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
counterattack, the fulfillment of the French Army tradition of aggression,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la baionette!</i> but it never came. Orders stopped it.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Who gave the orders? Pétain was not an active officer then.</em></p>

<p>A. No, but General George was. I want to give you my evidence
in the form of a firsthand quotation from a French friend, but before
I do so it is important to point out that between General
Gamelin, commander in chief of all the Allied land forces, and
General George, commander of the French armies fighting against
Germany, there existed a jealousy so strong that it amounted to
hatred, and their headquarters staffs became so permeated with it
that they actually withheld information from each other.</p>

<p>Here then, were the principal elements and forces involved in
the great conspiracy: First, Pétain, towering above all other figures
and forces; then the Deuxième Bureau, the famous Second Bureau
in charge of Intelligence of the French Army; General George and
General Dusseigneur and Colonel Eugene Deloncle; the Cagoulards,
that secret society of so-called Hooded Men, which most people
considered merely absurd but whose importance turned out to be
greater than that of any French secret society since the Revolution;
the group operating the Fascist weekly, <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite>; and on the
German side Otto Abetz, now Hitler’s ambassador to France, and
the unlimited money and propaganda of Himmler’s Gestapo, Goebbels’
Ministry, Ribbentrop’s Foreign Office, and the Ausland’s Buro.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Now I shall let my French friend talk. This is his report: from
here to <a href="#Ref_262">page 262</a> he is speaking in the first person.</em></p>

<p>On June 17, 1940, I found myself standing outside a wayside
tavern in France. I was one of the millions retreating southward
from occupied Paris ahead of the German Army. I had stopped by
the roadside because, through the open window of the inn, I heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
a radio broadcasting the pathetic voice of an old man. Marshal
Pétain was telling the French nation that he had decided to ask
Hitler to grant France an armistice.</p>

<p>Standing beside me was a young artillery lieutenant. As the last
words of the old Marshal died away, he turned toward me, pale as
ivory, and exclaimed: “Now I begin to understand! They forced
us to retreat so that we would have to accept this armistice, so that
the Germans could come in to do their dirty work for them!”</p>

<p>I didn’t dare understand. “How do you mean?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so naive!” he exploded. “Can’t you see what’s happened?
Don’t you remember that handful of enthusiastic young
fools who were always shouting ‘Pétain in power!’ Well, now he is
in power. He can govern with the aid of German troops. He has
opened the way for them to occupy the country. The Germans
will make the arrests and carry out the executions, and when their
opponents have all been put out of the way, Pétain and his friends
will be in possession of the kind of Nazified country they like.
Mark my words&mdash;this is not the end, but only the beginning. This
is not war; it’s a domestic political maneuver!”</p>

<p>At that moment it seemed that only a man completely out of his
mind could have believed what the young officer had just said. A
higher officer who had been listening broke in to correct him. Pétain,
he said, was very old and possibly not very intelligent. But he
certainly could not be a traitor.</p>

<p>“His first consideration,” this officer went on, “will be to obtain
reasonable terms from the enemy. I doubt very much whether he
will give any time at all to internal political questions. All Frenchmen,
all the legislators, all the people, will be behind him in his
struggle against the Germans. What greater power could he gain
by bringing about an internal political transformation?”</p>

<p>I said nothing but I was deeply anxious. <em>Why had Pétain announced
publicly that he had asked for an armistice before he was
sure that honorable conditions would be granted?</em> The mere fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
of an announcement’s having been made would complete the shattering
of army morale and all hope of further resistance, and make
it impossible, in case satisfactory terms could not be achieved, to
reshape a fighting army and resume the struggle. Pétain’s radio
speech seemed at the very least unwise&mdash;<em>unless its object were to
eliminate the slightest chance that the armistice might not go
through</em>. And in that case, the young officer was probably right.</p>

<p>Two dominant theories to explain the fall of France emerge:
(1) France’s rapid debacle was due to complete unpreparedness,
both physical and spiritual; (2) France was sold out, and what happened
is to be explained primarily by the operations of treason.
Both explanations are a part of the truth; neither of them is the
whole truth.</p>

<p>There was a lack of matériel of all sorts&mdash;infantry weapons and
artillery, ammunition, tanks, planes, etc. It was true also that production
in the munitions factories was increasing slowly, and that
the pace would have been insufficient if the intense warfare of the
last five weeks had had to be continued over a long period. But
the fact was that the period of intense warfare was very short; and
it is hardly logical to say that France was beaten because she
would have lacked ammunition if the war had lasted longer.</p>

<p>Some observers have imagined that France lacked munitions
even for so short a war, for it has been established that there were
shortages at many vital points. I talked with literally hundreds of
soldiers and officers during the retreat of June. Infantrymen complained
that they were given only three or four bullets per rifle;
artillerymen said that whole batteries were left without shells;
tanks ran out of gasoline at the very beginning of action and had
no chance to refuel, and worst of all (everyone stressed this as
having been the most discouraging factor), German planes had
complete and undisputed freedom in the air. Again and again
soldiers told me that during engagements, with hundreds of German
planes above, on not one occasion did French aviation come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
to the aid of the infantry. It was not surprising, under such conditions,
that morale gave way, and that the army was psychologically
prepared for the final collapse.</p>

<p>But was this lack of matériel at points essential to the defense
the result of a general shortage or simply of failure to get existing
munitions to the necessary centers? It seems indisputable that
it was the distributing system which was at fault. And was this
breakdown of the supply lines simply due to lack of organization,
or to a much more serious cause&mdash;treason? Whatever the case, it
is a fact that the retreating soldiers and officers, drawing their conclusions
from such facts as they had been able to witness, were
unanimous in exclaiming: “We have been sold out!”</p>

<p>Now listen to the story of a reserve officer, a captain of a
machine-gun detachment, one of the many with whom I talked.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me,” he said, “that our General Headquarters lacked
experience in supply problems, or that they forgot to send us
cartridges for our machine guns. In 1914-1918 they had no trouble
of this kind. There were situations quite as complicated as this
one again and again during that war, but the ammunition always
arrived. This short action hasn’t exhausted our reserve of matériel.
The depots are still full. Yet we at the front lines had to
destroy our machine guns to save them from the enemy when we
ran out of ammunition for them and had to fall back. The same
thing happened all along the front, for machine guns, artillery of
all calibers, and antitank guns. You can call it disorganization, if
you want. I call it intentional disorganization&mdash;sabotage, directed,
probably, from the same central point. But I don’t dare yet to try
to form any conclusions, to understand why such sabotage took
place. Perhaps one day we shall all understand.”</p>

<p>On the roads choked with retreating columns and fleeing refugees,
where military trucks and civilian cars were inextricably
mingled, soldiers talked of their misgivings during the waits, often
hours long, for jammed highways to be cleared so that traffic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
could resume its interminable southward crawl. Scores of times,
caught in such blocks, I heard soldiers or officers say: “Why are
we constantly ordered to retreat? We haven’t been in any real
engagement since the Somme. We’re not afraid to fight, but the
retreat orders keep us moving to the rear as fast as we can get
over these encumbered roads. What is the cause of this continual
flight? Aren’t they ever going to establish a line of resistance and
order us to hold it?”</p>

<p>They never did. One June 16, two days after Paris had been
occupied by the Germans, I found myself on the right bank of
the Loire, at the Nevers bridge. My car, heavily loaded with the
members of my family and all our luggage, had developed motor
trouble. Our most urgent need was to get across that river; for we
supposed of course, that the retreating troops would stop on the
other side of the natural line of defense constituted by the Loire,
which it should have been possible to hold for weeks, and possibly
forever. Across that bridge, we thought, lay safety.</p>

<p>We tried to persuade passing cars to tow us across. All of them,
civilian and military vehicles alike, passed us by. Their occupants
intent on the pursuing Germans, had no thought for anything except
to get across that bridge themselves. So we all got out except
a young girl who took the steering wheel, and pushed the car over
what seemed to be the longest bridge in the world.</p>

<p>We felt better when we got to the other side, with the wide
river between us and the enemy. I found a colonel supervising the
retreat of his troops, and asked him if he could direct me to the
officer in charge of the sector, thinking that he could probably let
me have a mechanic to repair the car.</p>

<p>“There is no officer in charge here,” the colonel said. “We are
all passing through without stopping, so there is no organization at
this point. I’m sorry I can’t do anything for you. You had better
get out of here as quickly as you can. The Germans will probably
be here in an hour.” From these words I realized with a shock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
that the defense of the left bank of the Loire was not even being
considered, and that the army was retreating indefinitely. I looked
up and down the long banks of the river. There were no fortified
positions whatsoever. I saw only one lonely soldier standing by
the side of a machine gun. He seemed to be wondering whether
he had been forgotten there.</p>

<p>South of the Loire, the bewilderment of the troops deepened,
for all of them had expected that that line would be held. Time
and again I heard the question asked: “Where are we going?”
Those who clung to hope to the last declared desperately: “The
generals must have a plan. Our orders are to retreat as quickly as
we can. There must be reasons for it.” But most of them simply
gave up the attempt to understand what was going on, and why
no effort was being made to resist.</p>

<p>For three months after the armistice I remained in France. I
wanted to find out the story behind the defeat. What I have to
tell is not pure hypothesis. It is the only possible explanation which
can be deduced from a number of unknown or little known facts
which I took the greatest trouble to verify. Here is the story:</p>

<p>There has been ample occasion in recent years to observe Nazi
propaganda tactics, among them the method which consists in selecting
the most appropriate arguments to convince any group the
Nazis wish to win over, even when those arguments are directly
contrary to those used with another group. Such a procedure
would seem on the surface likely to defeat its own aims; but it is
the tendency of each group to believe what it wants to believe,
that Hitler is telling the truth, while deceiving its adversaries. It
is the same state of mentality which confidence men evoke in such
tested swindles as the rosary game, in which the sucker is led to
see himself as the accomplice in victimizing someone else and thus
never imagines that he is marked for the role of victim himself.</p>

<p>It was in this fashion that Germany laid the foundation for
France’s defeat by corrupting different groups of the population<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
in different ways. Agents of Berlin told the French Communists,
for instance, that Germany was Soviet Russia’s ally, and that if
Hitler won the war, he would not oppose a Communist Revolution
in France. The new French Soviet Republic could then conclude
an alliance with Germany, Russia, and Italy and take part
in the totalitarian reconstruction of postwar Europe. French
Communist leaders swallowed this propaganda, and the result was
slowing down of production in munitions plants due to insidious
Communist propaganda against which the Interior Ministry tried
in vain to take effective measures.</p>

<p>There were many evidences that Communists believed they
were working in accord with Germany. After the armistice, Communist
factory workers in the occupied region on several occasions
started the singing of the <cite>Internationale</cite> in the factories
where they were employed with the idea that this would please
their new masters, and were surprised that it didn’t.</p>

<p>During the war, the Communists had been given reasons for believing
that they were on the side of the Germans. Some of the
French Bolshevik leaders who deserted during the war fled to Germany.
Findings of French radiogoniometric services proved that
Communist short-wave stations broadcasting in French were operating
from Germany. After the German troops reached Paris, several
young French writers known for their Communist sympathies,
who had remained behind when most other Leftists had fled, were
immediately given important places, such as the editing of Paris
daily papers, by the Nazi authorities. These incidents demonstrate
that the Germans had succeeded in establishing relationships
with French Communist leaders during the war; but it must be
recorded that the majority of Communist workmen remained definitely
hostile to the Nazis.</p>

<p>This failure to enlist the support among the Communist rank and
file which had been found among the leaders convinced the German
secret service early that there was no real chance of bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
about the defeat of France by fomenting a Bolshevik revolution.
If such a method had been feasible, Nazi Germany would certainly
not have hesitated to apply it, just as Imperial Germany did
not hesitate to send Lenin and his companions in their famous
sealed railroad coach into Russia in 1917.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, the Communist movement was taken
advantage of by the Germans only to the extent of being employed
to create as much unrest as possible among French workers,
who did not even realize to what influences they were being
exposed. The chief effort of German secret agents was concentrated
on conservative circles, which, according to reports received
at the Wilhelmstrasse, were in a much better position to
exert effective influence on the outcome of the war.</p>

<p>There was nothing contradictory about this willingness on the
part of the Nazis to cooperate with either the extreme Left or the
extreme Right, or even with both simultaneously, since their object,
whatever their dupes might think, was not to help them to
victory, but to use them as a tool to weaken the unity and the
power of the government. Nazi propaganda welcomed any loophole
through which it might penetrate into the vitals of a foreign
country with the aid of any resistance to the regime which might
already exist there.</p>

<p>For years before the war, the Nazis had established contact with
reactionary Rightist circles in France. One such circle which in
America has been accused of having been influenced by the Germans
and having perhaps contributed to France’s downfall is the
Croix de Feu, at one time generally considered as the future
Fascist movement of France. I must say that I could find neither
proof nor indication that the Croix de Feu had played Germany’s
game. On the contrary, the <cite>Petit Journal</cite>, published by Colonel
François de la Rocque, the Croix de Feu leader, assumed a more
courageously anti-German attitude after the armistice than did most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
other papers published under the control of the Vichy government.</p>

<p>Two other less conspicuous, but perhaps more influential Right-wing
groups were, however, definitely approached by the Germans
during the prewar years. One of them was the secret revolutionary
organization popularly known as the Cagoulards (the
Hooded ones); the other was the group which published the
weekly, <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite>. These contacts were established chiefly
by Otto Abetz, infamous “special delegate” of Nazi Foreign
Minister von Ribbentrop, who was expelled from France shortly
before the war. On his initiative, members of both groups undertook
several trips to Berlin between 1937 and 1939 to discuss means
of action.</p>

<p>The German secret service had a particular interest in these two
groups because, while entirely independent of each other, they
had one thing in common&mdash;far-reaching ties with the French
Army.</p>

<p>The Cagoulard group was headed by French officers of high
rank&mdash;majors, colonels, and even generals. General Dusseigneur
was among those arrested when the Cagoulard movement was uncovered
shortly before the war after it had planted bombs in Paris.
The dissolution of the movement made its members more cautious,
but its underground activities continued.</p>

<p>If any further evidence of German support for the Cagoulards
had been needed beyond that already turned up by the French
police, it was provided by the Germans themselves. When they
occupied Paris, one of the first things they did was to demand that
the French national police turn over the files on the Cagoulard
case. From these files, the Germans learned the names of the police
commissioners who had unearthed the Cagoulard plot, and immediately
arrested those who were in occupied territory.</p>

<p>This was in striking contrast to the treatment of the arrested
Cagoulard leaders, all of whom had been released by the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
government by the beginning of the war. Shortly after the start of
hostilities I met in the train the brother of one of the Cagoulards
who had been arrested. In the ensuing conversation, I remarked
that I was astonished that responsible adults should have indulged
at such a time in what then appeared to have been a somewhat
childish imitation of a motion picture conspiracy. Nettled by my
attitude, my interlocutor answered:</p>

<p>“You don’t understand how serious this movement was. It was
organized by the Deuxième Bureau (the department of the army
concerned with espionage and counterespionage). It was at the
instigation of the military secret service that my brother and his
friends organized the Cagoulards. That can’t be told now, of
course, but the day will come when all the truth will be known,
and my brother will be considered a hero for the time he has spent
in prison.”</p>

<p>“The Deuxième Bureau!” I exclaimed incredulously. “Why in
the world should the Deuxième Bureau want to foster a revolutionary
movement when it’s already so near the power itself?”</p>

<p>“Ever since the 1936 elections,” he answered, “important members
of the French secret service have been very much worried
about the influence the Communist movement has gained in this
country, and so they decided to take matters into their own hands.
The Cagoulard movement was formed to do that. The Popular
Front ministers got my brother and his friends put in jail, but
you’ll see that they haven’t said their last word yet.”</p>

<p><cite>Je Suis Partout</cite>, the weekly which was another outpost of German
propaganda in France, belonged originally to the publishing
house of Fayard, which put out books and another and more prosperous
political weekly, <cite>Candide</cite>. <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> was a money
loser and publisher Arthème Fayard decided several years ago to
discontinue it. When the news got out, Pierre Gaxotte, editor of
the paper, proposed to Fayard that he turn the paper’s name over
to him instead of giving him severance pay, since he thought he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
might be able to keep the magazine going himself. Fayard agreed,
and <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> continued to appear without interruption, and
so far as the public knew, without any change in its control. Circulation
did not increase. Advertising continued low. The paper
showed no signs of prosperity&mdash;but it did not show any signs of
having financial difficulties any more either.</p>

<p>Pierre Gaxotte, as well as some other members of his editorial
staff, had begun his political career in the Royalist <cite>Action
Française</cite> movement, but had apparently decided to strike out for
himself and cut his own political tracks. Under Gaxotte’s direction,
<cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> assumed a definitely pro-German attitude,
arguing that France and Germany should come to an understanding
between themselves as the two great continental powers, leaving
England out in the cold. Paul Ferdonnet, who won fame later
as the “traitor of Stuttgart” delivering propaganda broadcasts in
French from the Stuttgart radio station during the war (he is now
supervisor of the French radio in Paris), was also on the editorial
staff until he went to Berlin to establish his permanent residence
and his own press syndicate there. From that time on, he was the
secret liaison agent between the German authorities and Gaxotte’s
paper.</p>

<p>The German sympathies of <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> were apparent
enough, but no one bothered much about it, for circulation was
low and the paper’s influence was considered to be negligible. This
must have been the viewpoint of the Daladier government also,
for except for friendly arguments with the censors, the paper was
able to continue publishing unhampered even after the war broke
out.</p>

<p>When Daladier resigned and Paul Reynaud came in, he appointed
Georges Mandel Minister of the Interior, and thus head
of the French police organization. Although Mandel, zealous, patriotic,
and uncompromising, like his master Clemenceau whose
secretary he had been during the last war, undertook to hunt down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
defeatists of all descriptions, <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> continued to appear as
usual. Mandel also apparently considered it too insignificant to be
dangerous.</p>

<p>But one day a well-known French journalist brought to Mandel
the proof that the principal members of the editorial staff of <cite>Je
Suis Partout</cite> were simultaneously agents of the Deuxième Bureau.
Mandel was astounded. He who knew all the undercurrents of
French political life, who for years had kept secret files about all
public figures, had not dreamed that any connection could have
existed between this outspokenly pro-German magazine and one
of the most influential departments of the French Army. He had
put the editors of <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> down as innocuous fools. He
now realized that though the circulation of the paper was small,
the private influence of its editors might have been both great and
disastrous.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate an instant. He ordered immediately the arrest
of five members of the staff. Among them was an obscure
journalist, not generally known as a member of the staff, named
Pierre Mouton, who some years before had founded a small press
syndicate called <cite>Prima Presse</cite> in partnership with Ferdonnet.
Mandel quickly obtained proof that the two men were still cooperating.
Mouton, while maintaining permanent contact with <cite>Je
Suis Partout</cite>, was also flooding the French daily press with cleverly
prepared pro-German articles which were supplied to the newspapers
free of charge.</p>

<p>With the known leaders of the <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> group in jail,
Mandel apparently thought that there was no immediate urgency
for delving further into this particular case when so many other
vital matters pressed for attention. The same attitude had been
taken a few years before in regard to the Cagoulards, who seemed
to have been set down as definitely muzzled because their figureheads
had been imprisoned. Neither the stern and Spartan Mandel,
who had arrested the <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> group, nor the vivacious and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
epicurean Albert Sarraut, his predecessor, who had handled the
Cagoulard case, imagined that either of these two groups had
achieved a real and lasting penetration into the high command&mdash;a
penetration which seems to have contributed largely to the debacle
of May and June.</p>

<p>Possibly the two cases had never been laid side by side so that
the telltale fact that both times a trail led to the Deuxième Bureau
had not been observed. Perhaps also the two Interior Ministers had
hesitated each time before venturing to have civilian authorities investigate
the most powerful of the military departments. The
Deuxième Bureau of the French Army was sometimes called “a
state within the state.” It might more exactly have been called
“several states within the state,” for it was a complicated organism
with its own currents and undercurrents, comprising a number of
competing groups. Somewhere within this complicated office
existed the only link between the pro-German <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> and
the German-inspired Cagoulards; but on the surface, at least at the
beginning, no relation seemed to exist between these two separate
activities.</p>

<p>The Cagoulard movement, although it had started in the
Deuxième Bureau, soon succeeded through the interlinking relationships
of high officers, some of whom supported its activities, in
putting out tentacles into the first and third bureaus of the army
as well&mdash;those concerned respectively with direction of operations
and supplies&mdash;in other words the two departments which in June
were responsible respectively for the orders to retreat and for the
failure of the front-line troops to receive ammunition and aid
from the aviation.</p>

<p>It may be noted also that several of these high officers who were
sympathetic to the Cagoulard movement were in particularly close
contact with Marshal Pétain who had his own devoted followers
in the army, just as all other first-rank military leaders, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Gamelin and Weygand, had also, whether they were on the active
list or retired.</p>

<p>All this may seem incredible. It is difficult to believe that French
officers of high rank should have acted in the interests of Germany
during the war, thus contributing to bring about their country’s
downfall. Even though the Cagoulards, an emanation of the
Deuxième Bureau, may have maintained contact with the Germans
several years before the war; even if unsuccessful newspapermen
like Gaxotte may have made up for deficits by accepting subsidies
from the Nazis, it still seems fantastic that the military leaders
of France, whose patriotism no one has ever doubted, should
have acted as traitors in time of war. It seems to be a moral impossibility.</p>

<p>The explanation is simple. Neither the Cagoulards, nor the editors
of <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite>, nor the French officers who were in relations
with them, ever believed at any moment that they were
traitors. If history sets them down as having betrayed France, the
verdict will be incomprehensible to them. They believed themselves
to be patriots. It is our privilege, if we wish, to see them
rather as pitiful victims of German Propaganda.</p>

<p>What happened was this: Long before the war, the Nazi secret
service realized that both the Cagoulards and the staff of <cite>Je Suis
Partout</cite> were worth cultivating because of their connections with
members of the French General Staff, and with officers of influence
close to such leaders as Pétain, among others.</p>

<p>Friendly relations were established, and the Germans hammered
away with arguments like these:</p>

<p>“You Frenchmen consider that we Germans are your hereditary
enemies. There’s no reason why you should think so. Our two
peoples should be able to live and work side by side without
friction. It’s true we’ve had trouble in the past, but why? Because
England, who can only maintain her influence on the continent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
if the continental nations are divided, has constantly stirred us up
against each other.</p>

<p>“Besides that, we have not fought against the real France. Our
wars were against the French Republic. For 150 years that regime
has usurped the place of the real France. In 1789 the English provoked
the French Revolution to weaken your nation, and since
then your people seem to have forgotten its great destiny.</p>

<p>“The Revolution of France started in the lodges of Freemasonry,
which were implanted in your country by England.
The Freemasons operated with English and Jewish help; for the
last 150 years, you have been under the control of the same powers.
For the last twenty years these powers have been cooperating with
international Communism and thus have brought another danger
into your country.</p>

<p>“Wake up! Denounce the English alliance, expel the Jews from
important positions, suppress Freemasonry, as we have done in
Germany. The danger of Communism will be over, and there will
be no obstacle to a happy and peaceful understanding between
France and Germany.”</p>

<p>This bait was eagerly taken. It made no difference that this
account was inaccurate, and might easily have been refuted. It was
the sort of thing that right-wing Frenchmen of anti-Republican
and antidemocratic leanings were ready to hear, and it provided
a moral basis for cooperation between them and the Germans.
Supplied with a patriotic motive for destroying their domestic
political opponents, convinced that in so doing they would not
open the way to the hereditary enemy but on the contrary make
him a friend, these Frenchmen no longer had any scruples about
accepting subsidies for the arming of the Cagoulards and the publication
of <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite> from an ally in the common cause of
continental peace and friendship.</p>

<p>The Germans had found the ideal sophism with which to gain
friends within the French Army. They realized, of course, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
they could not hope to influence a majority of General Staff officers,
but they knew also that an active minority, so convinced it
is right that it is willing to use any methods to achieve its aims, can
arrive at its objectives at decisive moments by obstructing the
course of action decided upon by the majority. And among the
officers whom German propaganda had reached were many so
placed that they could easily block the complicated intermeshing
gears of the army machine at the critical juncture.</p>

<p>Relationships between the Germans and their friends in France
were maintained even after the beginning of the war through various
neutral countries. Ferdonnet continued to communicate with
Mouton and the staff of <cite>Je Suis Partout</cite>. Michelin, the big automobile
tire manufacturer whose name was whispered all over
France as that of one of the men behind the Cagoulards, sent frequent
messengers to Switzerland. Pétain himself was French Ambassador
to Spain, and several members of his entourage maintained
contact with members of the German Embassy in Madrid. There
were even rumors that Pétain had secret meetings with the German
Ambassador, though this was denied. The theme the Germans
were singing to their French friends now was a development of
that which they had dinned into them earlier. It had evolved into
this:</p>

<p>“We did not want this war. You yourselves did your utmost to
avoid it. But now that it has come it is a fact which we cannot
leave out of account. Both of us wanted to create a better understanding
between our two countries, to be followed by an alliance.
The war now prevents us from reaching our goal by direct
means.</p>

<p>“If you concluded a separate peace with us, we could still become
your allies. We know, of course, that you and your friends,
who have the true interests of your country at heart, and can see
into the future more clearly than the others, would eagerly accept
this solution. But you have not the power to do it; and even if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
had, the people who have been worked up by war propaganda to
hate us, would never agree to it. There is only one case now in
which the French people would accept a separate peace; and that,
unfortunately, is if France suffers a military defeat.</p>

<p>“It must seem monstrous to you even to envisage a French
defeat. We understand that. We sympathize with you. But suppose
you knew that it would not be a real defeat. Suppose we could
arrange a simulated defeat, which would bring the French people
to accept the idea of an armistice whether the English are ready
to fight or not?</p>

<p>“We can give you a binding promise that if France can be
apparently defeated in this manner, she will not be treated as a
defeated nation. On the contrary, you will immediately become
Germany’s ally and we will cooperate to build up a new order in
Europe. You have only to break definitely with England as proof
of your good faith.</p>

<p>“Of course, a brief occupation of certain parts of France by
German troops would be necessary to make the defeat look real
and to persuade the population to accept it. One of the purposes
of the occupation would be to purge France of the elements which
you dislike just as much as we do, and which stand in your way
in your task of resuscitating the real France from her torpor of a
century and a half. But when it is all over, when our troops have
been withdrawn, you will be in control of a new and reborn France
which with the new Germany will impose upon Europe an era of
strength and prosperity for both of us.”</p>

<p>Once again the bait was taken. Its effect was felt in extremely
influential circles. I have personally been able to verify conclusively
the fact that Marshal Pétain, having invited two highly
placed Spaniards to dine with him in Hendaye in November 1939,
said to his guests: “Do not judge France by its present appearance.
Democracy is finished everywhere. Next spring will see a movement
in France comparable to your own national uprising.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span></p>

<p>Such a phrase in the mouth of a French Ambassador who was
at the same time a French military leader was extremely significant.
What other meaning could a revolt in wartime have except that
its intent was to end the war? What other reason could there have
been for waiting until spring except that this period was the best
for a German offensive?</p>

<p>It was not necessary, as I have already noted above, to transform
all or even a majority of the officers of the French General Staff,
into accomplices in order to provoke a French defeat. If in a big
business, a few accountants, an assistant cashier, the head of the
sales department, and one or two keymen in the stock department
took part in a conspiracy to ruin the firm, their simultaneous
coordinated sabotage would inevitably achieve their aim&mdash;and with
particular ease if the organization of the company were faulty.</p>

<p>There were some faults with the French Army, certainly. Was
morale unsatisfactory? Was equipment inadequate? Undoubtedly,
but the situation in these respects was not strikingly different from
that of 1914-1918. The decisive factor seems to have been faults
in the high command&mdash;important information regarding the movements
of the enemy was not relayed in time, orders to army corps
suffered considerable delays, the supply service left equipment and
matériel of all sorts in the depots instead of sending it to strategically
important points. From June 13 on, troops in good fighting
shape received everywhere mysterious orders for retreat which
puzzled them most of all, at the same time that French statesmen
were hearing from French generals (most of them may have
spoken with complete good faith), that all troops were fleeing in
disorder. Confusion was so great and news of the retreat so unexpected
that nobody thought to investigate the hidden causes of
the disaster.</p>

<p>Shortly after the armistice, the same announcement was repeated
in French by the Stuttgart radio several evenings in succession. It
was this: “Frenchmen, in a few days we will give you the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
of an outstanding countryman of yours who was our principal
agent in France, and who helped to bring about your defeat.”</p>

<p>Everyone in the French unoccupied zone either heard this
broadcast or heard about it. There was naturally a good deal of
guessing as to the name that would be given by the Germans. For
my part, I made a bet that no name would ever be given by Stuttgart.
My reasoning was this: That there was such a man or men I
didn’t doubt for an instant. But I didn’t doubt also that he had not
expected the terrible armistice conditions imposed upon France.
He had led his country into what he had thought would be a fake
defeat on the basis of his confidence in the honesty of the Germans.
By then he had discovered that they were not honest, and
that it was a real defeat that had been inflicted upon the country.
He saw that the Nazis intended to treat the country with all the
severity of genuine conquerors, and that he and his friends had
been dupes.</p>

<p>I supposed then, that this man had tried to force the Germans
to live up to their promises and to treat France as an ally. He
would have pointed out that the new Pétain government had
turned against England, as had been agreed. And he would have
threatened to reveal everything if Germany did not hold to her
bargain, thus ending the acceptance of defeat on the part of the
French people by letting them know that they had not in fact
been militarily defeated.</p>

<p>Germany’s answer was the Stuttgart broadcast. Her French
agent had tried to threaten her. She simply returned the blackmail,
reminding him forcefully that the Reich no longer cared whether
the French people knew how it had been defeated or not, since the
Army was disbanded, the strategic points occupied, and the people
helpless to resume the fight. He was reminded also what his own
position would be if the story came out. He saw that he had to
keep silence to save himself, and the Germans, perfectly willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
that silence should be kept, never honored their promise to reveal
his name.</p>

<p>It was on the basis of this theory that I expected in advance
that the Stuttgart radio would not follow up its announcement.
Since it did not, I feel justified in assuming that the reasoning
which enabled me to arrive at a correct prediction was probably
correct itself.</p>

<p>As if to confirm all this, Pétain himself later made a very mild
speech in which he timidly asked the Germans whether they intended
to accept the new France as a full-fledged partner in the
reconstruction of Europe. France’s new rulers have kept all the
promises they had given the Germans. They have cut off relationships
with England, dissolved the Freemasons, attacked the Jews,
delivered up anti-Hitler German refugees, fought the British at
Oran, Dakar, and in Syria. They have slavishly obeyed Hitler’s
commands and now they are naively surprised because Hitler has
not kept his promise to free France and make her independent
again. With the true psychology of a dupe they had believed that
Hitler might fool others, but never themselves.</p>

<p id="Ref_262"><em>That ends the statement of my French friend.</em></p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How would you sum up Pétain? Is he a patriot or a traitor, or
misguided, or what?</em></p>

<p>A. He is first of all a very old, too-old man. Only a man who had
lost his judgment could surrender his country to Hitler as Hindenburg
did and as Pétain did, both under a profound misconception
of Hitler. Pétain is intensely religious and identifies Communism
with anti-Christ, the only enemy, failing to perceive that the most
powerful foe of Christianity to appear on earth since Christ lived
is Hitler. It is a mistake to call Pétain a Fascist; he is a medievalist.
He believes the principal goal of life is to prepare for the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
world, and the man who can do that best is the man whose activity
is closest to nature, the peasant, and the man whose mind is not
confused by learning, the illiterate peasant. Therefore he wants a
France of uneducated, devout peasants; he does not mind at all
the plan of Hitler to abolish French industry.</p>

<p>He is a defeatist at heart; the affairs of this earth are not worth
fighting for. It is on record that at Verdun he several times wished
to surrender. As a defeatist he believes in superior force and can
be as ruthless when he is in possession of it as he can be submissive
when he has lost it. His suppression of the mutinies in the French
Army was notoriously harsh; the statistics of the killed have yet to
be published. He accepts the French birth rate as a fact of
superior force to which France must bow and his experience of
the bloodletting at Verdun reinforced his conviction that France
ought not to try to maintain a predominant place in Europe.</p>

<p>As an old man his vivid memories are of the past, and Germany,
though marching under the pirate swastika, remained for him in
1940 the Germany which let France off lightly in 1871. He once
told a friend how impressed he was with the behavior of the German
commander at Verdun who allowed French officers to retain
their swords after one of the surrenders of Douaumont. In this
venerable confidence that he was dealing with gentlemen, he gave
up. The most pathetic words uttered in this war were those of
Pétain when he addressed his petition for an armistice to Hitler
with the words, “I speak as soldier to soldier.”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why was that pathetic; isn’t Hitler a soldier?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, indeed, but the meaning of the old marshal’s words was,
“I speak to you as gentleman to gentleman,” and that is the most
pathetic sentence of the war, because it contains the utter failure
of the French to understand that not only is Hitler not a gentleman,
but Hitler would be the first indignantly to repudiate a title<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
he despises. The code of a gentleman is derived from the Christian
code, which Hitler and his Nazi-Nietzchean followers despise.
They curse Christ as a Jewish weakling whose religion is for slaves.
They spit upon the elementary idea of fair play. A group of devoted
young Nazis, a dozen strong, who have just beaten to death
a crippled Jew, will be clear of conscience, joyful as though they
had done a good deed, and utterly unable to understand the American
or British notion that it is not even enjoyable sport to attack
with odds of twelve to one. It is sport to them. Pétain had not
the faintest notion that the sons of the Germans he had known
had come to this. So with his eyes closed, and dreaming of the past,
he accepted the promise of a position for France of junior partner
to Germany.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is Pétain moved by personal ambition?</em></p>

<p>A. He is consumed by it. He did not accept with reluctance the
post of “Chief of the Government” after Reynaud fell, but gladly,
feeling that he had finally received the recognition denied him
when Foch was made Commander in Chief. He does not consider
himself a Fuehrer or a Duce. He is much nearer the position of his
fellow clericalist, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caudillo</i>, Franco, who never clearly understood
the meaning of Nazism and was repelled by what he did
understand.</p>

<p>Pétain does not understand Fascism or Nazism but only sees
that they control the mob, and he wishes above all to see the mob
controlled as an army, to be drilled and disciplined into hardworking,
God-fearing Frenchmen, obedient in civil as in religious
life. His religious feeling dominates all his actions. In Bordeaux,
the day Reynaud resigned, I was told Pétain’s words as he heard
the debacle was reaching its end: “France must suffer for her
sins!” Mystically he surrendered, and mystically he still exclaimed
a year later to a nation which had endured twelve months of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
injury and abasement with no prospect of relief, “You are suffering
and must suffer for a long time still because we have not yet
paid for all our mistakes.”</p>

<p>To the old Marshal, France’s troubles began with the Revolution
of 1789, and to cure them he wants to take France back to the
Ancien Regime. He wants to do away with liberty, because liberty
is synonymous with license and license with sin. Theoretically he
is a monarchist, but now that he has become Regent, like Horthy
of Hungary, he does not want a king. This period Pétain regards
as France’s purgatory, which he gladly endures, confident of a
better world. Many Frenchmen recognize Pétain’s good intentions
but do not believe they will save him from Hell.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why, if the Germans have such a hold over Pétain, have they
not forced him to surrender the French fleet and to give them the
use of the North African naval and air bases? If Pétain is in fear
of being revealed by the Germans as one who helped bring about
the French defeat, why can’t the Germans get anything they
want from him?</em></p>

<p>A. First, because Pétain is more useful to the Germans than the
French fleet and the North African bases. Who else could lead so
many of the French people to submit and collaborate as they are
doing today under Pétain? Pétain does Hitler’s work for him.
Pétain coaxes the plunder from the French people in the form of
taxes and hands it to Hitler in the form of payment for maintenance
of the army of occupation. If the Germans ever exposed
him, he would lose his position and they would lose their most
useful servant.</p>

<p>Second, the more time that elapses since the armistice, the less
effective is the German blackmail threat on Pétain, because as time
passes people become less interested in what happened, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
experience with the Germans deepens, fewer people can be found
to believe any German explanation.</p>

<p>Third, Pétain, with all his senility, must have realized that it is
not nearly as certain now that Germany will win, as it was when
he surrendered. The Russian resistance, much as Pétain hates and
despises Bolshevism, must have made him think; and the growing
belligerence of America must have had some effect upon him. As
he becomes less and less convinced that Germany is certain to win
he should logically become less submissive to the Germans. On the
other hand, he is not likely to revolt openly until he is convinced
Germany will lose; and the only way to give him such conviction
is for the United States to enter the war.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What would Hitler do if he finally tired of fooling with
Vichy?</em></p>

<p>A. He would simply march in and occupy all of France. He could
do it with a handful of divisions, since the French have been
totally disarmed or at least as fully disarmed as it was possible for
the Germans to do. But from then on he would have the trouble
of administering the whole country and collecting the taxes which
Pétain collects for him now. I do not think he is anxious to increase
his responsibilities that way now. Pétain knows this too,
and that stiffens the old man’s backbone a little. Essentially though
the Vichy attitude will always depend on the question who is
going to win the war. I should think that when the defeat of Hitler
is assured, the Vichy government may be overthrown and another
or Free French, de Gaulle government may re-enter the war on
our side. Pétain and Darlan it seems to me are too compromised
ever to do that.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What about Darlan?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span></p>

<p>A. Darlan undoubtedly sees more clearly than Pétain, but he is
less honorable; indeed I have heard highly placed Englishmen who
knew him intimately curse him with concentrated bitterness as the
vilest traitor of the lot. Few people would describe Pétain as consciously
dishonorable. Few of the men around Pétain are spared the
charge by Frenchmen who know them best.</p>

<p>Darlan has no respect from anybody. He has been all his life a
political sailor, having had his start from his father, one-time Minister
of Justice. His politics were consistently opportunistic. Today
he helps head a government that has suppressed Freemasonry;
yet he was a Freemason when to be a Freemason was an asset. He
helps keep Leon Blum in confinement; yet he supported Blum
when Blum was in power. He is now the fiercest advocate of fighting
England; yet until Reynaud fell he supported the policy of
moving the government to North Africa and carrying on.</p>

<p>He switched when he perceived the chance of becoming head
man in the appeasement government. His change of heart was literally
overnight. In London immediately after the fall of France, an
old friend of mine, an officer of the French Navy whose ship had
broken away and come to England, told me Darlan had issued an
order to all vessels of the Navy that with the signing of the Armistice
they should make for French African or other friendly ports
and prepare to go on with the war; twenty-four hours later another
code message from Darlan countermanded the order and directed
all ships to make for French ports. In the interval Darlan had been
promised a seat next to the Chief of the Vichy State.</p>

<p>Nothing in Darlan’s record indicates that he has ever acted
except for the purpose of furthering his career; he is characterized
by the French as the perfect careerist, and the word has even less
flattering connotations in French than in English. The one instinct
in him which seems to have persisted without variance is his hatred
of the British, based upon the centuries-old rivalry of the French
and British navies. While the French were in the war we Americans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
forgot that the memory of Trafalgar is for the French Navy, or
for its older officers anyway, stronger than the memory of the four
years of Franco-British comradeship on the battlefields of 1914-1918.</p>

<p>In Darlan this feeling was always strong. At the London Naval
Conference of 1930 he fought for parity with the British, but they
refused it to him, with a prescience blessed by the event. Suppose
the French had possessed as powerful a navy as the British when
the French Army fell and Darlan had commanded a force able to
challenge the British! After the Battle of Oran, July 3, 1940 when
the British, rightly suspecting the intentions of Darlan, attempted
to disable the French Fleet at Mers-el Kebir in order to prevent
its falling into the hands of the Germans, Darlan led the outcry
against the “perfidious” assault. The British are convinced that if
ever the chance comes Darlan will use every means in his power
to injure them. Whatever his motives may have been at the beginning
for joining the capitulation, Darlan like most of the men of
Vichy has by now so compromised himself with the French people
that, as one French friend of mine expressed it: “If Germany
is defeated the best these men of Vichy could hope for would be
dishonorable, furtive retirement, but I think most of them would
be killed.”</p>

<p>And if Germany wins? For a while Darlan and his colleagues
seemed to feel confident that Hitler would be good to them, but
now he exclaims: “If we do not get an honorable peace, if France
is cut up into many departments and deprived of important overseas
territories, and enters diminished and bruised into the New
Europe, it will not recover and our children will live in the misery
and hatred which breed war.” These words of the appeaser indicate
that he has already discerned the outlines of the fate Hitler has in
store for France; yet what is the alternative for him and those like
him now? Free Frenchmen declare the alternative is death, as
traitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>And Laval?</em></p>

<p>A. He is wounded but he is surely enjoying himself because for
the moment he can say, “I told you so.” He is probably the world’s
most delighted observer of the Battle of Russia. My last glimpse of
him was in Bordeaux at the restaurant “Chapon Fin” the night
France capitulated. The restaurant was crowded with the wealthy,
the powerful, the noted and notorious of France. The door was
locked; without an introduction from at least a Cabinet Minister
or a millionaire nobody could get in. That night ten thousand
refugees were pounding for admission to the restaurants of Bordeaux.
Our Ambassador to Poland, Tony Biddle, unmarked from
his harrowing escape across Poland under Luftwaffe machine-gun
fire, and as fresh here at the collapse of the world as though he were
attending a bridge party at home, rescued us and with a gesture
which implied we were all ambassadors, requisitioned a table for
our party of American newspapermen. From one corner Otto of
Habsburg greeted us in his cordial democratic way. He was one
victim Hitler would have liked to catch. I looked around the
grotesque dining room, decorated as an artificial rock garden of
papier-mâché and now populated by as queer a throng as ever
assembled to dine at the funeral of a nation. Nearly every French
politician I had ever seen was there, most of them drinking copiously
of the wine for which the city was famous. There was no
gloom perceptible; not among the Frenchmen. The atmosphere
was excited, laughter was frequent and high-pitched. Perhaps it
was bravery; the gay talk and conviviality sounded very courageous
or else very frivolous at that moment. Who could have
realized that there were Frenchmen there calculating to improve
their careers by the fall of their country? We American newspapermen
looked more depressed than any of the men whose motherland
was about to be strangled. Presently a waiter brought me a
note from Laval inviting me to his table. I had not seen him enter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
There he was, swarthy, ebony-haired, with his famous white string
tie, presiding over a company of half a dozen friends, all talking,
as everybody in the Western World was talking, about the fate
of France.</p>

<p>Abruptly Laval asked, “What do you think, M. Knickerbocker?”</p>

<p>I spoke with all the emphasis I could muster and placing my
fist on the table to help express my sincerity talked directly to him:
“Mr. President, I think that if you give up, if you surrender, it
will mean the end of France as a nation, the end of France forever
unless another, outside power comes to your rescue. But Mr. President,
if you go on fighting, if you refuse to surrender, even if you
have to go to North Africa and base your government on Morocco,
then France will live because she and her friends will win this
war, however long it may take. But please believe me, Mr. President,
when I say I know what the Nazis mean to do to France,
and I know because I have lived for nine years in Germany as a
professional observer and I know Adolf Hitler, and the Nazis,
and the German people better than I know any politician, or
political party, or people in the world, and I know they mean the
utter destruction of France.”</p>

<p>There was dead silence, and to my gratification everybody at
the table, all of Laval’s friends, nodded in agreement with me, but
M. Laval himself, grave as a judge, leaned back and with that
inscrutable Moorish air of his said, “No, M. Knickerbocker, you
do not understand. Hitler does not want to destroy France; Hitler
only wants to destroy the Soviet Union.”</p>

<p>That was Laval’s belief, and because this belief was shared by
so many other Frenchmen, it became one of the principal reasons
for the fall of France.</p>

<p>Whatever else one may think of him, Laval has guts and is no
hypocrite. He hates democracy and says so. He is out to promote
the fortunes of M. Laval and admits it. He calls himself a realist;
and realistically he long ago estimated the strength of France as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
inadequate to stand up against Germany. He learned to hate Britain
during those long years when every French move to bolster their
position against the doubly powerful Reich was checked by an
imbecile British Foreign Office which continued to think that the
balance of power required a stronger Germany and a weaker
France. So Laval’s belief in the desirability of a Franco-German
“understanding” was not born of defeat alone.</p>

<p>He was the first French Premier to visit Germany after the war.
I was in Berlin when he arrived in the autumn of 1931 with the
aging and feeble but still brilliant Briand, then Foreign Minister.
Bruening was Chancellor and that farsighted benevolent statesman,
whom the Allies could have helped suppress the growing menace
of Hitler, wished to make the visit the foundation for a new era of
Franco-German friendship. How futile his hopes were came to
light as the train bearing the French ministers rolled in. I was
standing with a small crowd of Germans at the foot of the steps of
the Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof, and noticed that the streets had been
cleared and roped off all the way to the Hotel Adlon. Masses of
police manned the ropes but there was almost no crowd to hold
back. Around the station were about five hundred people. I noticed
they looked curiously alike, as though all from the same neighborhood,
the same class. Presently I saw a friend, a plain-clothes man
from Police Headquarters, all dressed up in his Sunday best, with
gloves and a derby hat and the inevitable big detective’s shoes.
I greeted him. He introduced his wife and children. A little surprised,
I asked if he were such a great advocate of Franco-German
friendship that he had brought his whole family to cheer the visitors
from Paris. “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja wohl!</i>” he replied. “Orders, you see. They sent us
all down here. Everybody here is from Police Headquarters, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mit
Frau und Kinder</i>. Nobody else; no outsiders. We get a day off for
coming.” Sure enough, that was the makeup of the entire crowd.
They dutifully thronged around the steps and shouted “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hoch
Frankreich!</i>” Laval and Briand then passed through empty streets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
to the Hotel Adlon where another group of policemen and their
wives and children cried “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hoch!</i>” again. And that was the length
and breadth and depth of Franco-German friendship.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Has Laval a chance to come back?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, if the Germans win he has the best of chances. Laval today
is the only master politician left in France; Pétain is senile; Darlan
is ward-heel size; none of the others in the Vichy camp is even that
large, and the politicians of the Republic are dead and buried.
Laval is the best-hated Frenchman alive; the shots fired into him
by Colette were cheered from one end of France to the other, but
he is still the only Frenchman capable of ruling France as a
dictator.</p>

<p>He is much like Stalin, an Asiatic, with more than his share of
the Eastern blood of the Auvernacs. He has the psychology of
the Oriental and like Stalin he has the Oriental’s lack of human
consideration. As Stalin regards Russia without love, as an object,
so Laval regards France. He has few real friends but possesses a
marvelous power of extemporized comradeship and can talk the
language of any man with whom he converses, including, as one
of his enemies suggested, “even an honest man.” Once a friend of
his exclaimed, “You ought to be dictator of a South American
Republic!” “How did you know?” asked Laval, genuinely surprised.
“Oh, just a joke,” answered the friend. “But no,” said Laval,
“I am amazed, because when I was a boy that was just what I
always dreamed of becoming&mdash;dictator of a South American state.”
Perhaps he may get his wish yet, as the malicious wits of the
Riviera have called Vichy France, “a banana republic without
bananas.”</p>

<p>Laval’s hatred of England is extended now to America, because
American support upholds Britain, and Laval will never be safe
until Britain is defeated. He is still unwavering in his conviction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
that Germany will win, but even if we entered the war and it
became evident Germany would lose, Laval cannot now change
his position. He is one of those so totally committed to the German
cause that he stands or falls with it.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You have said that we Americans were very much like the
French; now in what way are we? Have we also traitors in our
ranks?</em></p>

<p>A. No, we have not, I am convinced, any traitors among our officers,
as the French had. There are many Nazi agents among us,
and a few may have penetrated to positions of some importance,
but I do not believe they could affect the issue of the war as they did
in France. There are many Communists as well among us, probably
more than there are Nazis, and we ought never to forget that
whether they are native-born Americans or not makes no difference.
Nor does the fact that Soviet Russia is momentarily engaged
in fighting our enemy change the essential fact that Communists
cannot be loyal Americans. Their loyalty is to Moscow alone, and
if a change in Russia’s position should make it expedient for the
Kremlin to order American Communists to sabotage America’s
war effort, the order would be zealously obeyed.</p>

<p>Our chief danger of this sort lies in the wrongheaded activity of
our isolationists who, whether they wish it or not, serve the cause
of Hitler more effectively than all the paid agents of Germany and
Italy and Japan could do if their numbers were multiplied many
times. Consider carefully the account given you by my French
friend of the way the Germans appealed to Parisian conservative
circles, and ask yourself if their arguments do not sound remarkably
like the speeches of Lindbergh and Wheeler.</p>

<p>Treason can be difficult to define. I had a French friend, whom
I can call a friend no longer because he became one of the chief
collaborationists with the Germans. I think&mdash;I am not sure&mdash;but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
think we have no one like him in America, but he was so representative
of the group that betrayed France, that I want to quote
a conversation I had with him just before the war began. I said,
“Jean, you seem to believe profoundly that Germany is strong
enough to win a war no matter how France fights to prevent it;
and you also seem to believe that the German kind of National
Socialism would be a good thing for the whole continent, including
France. Now what would you do, believing as you do, if France
were to be at war with Germany, and you thought defeat was inevitable,
and you foresaw a long and bloody conflict, and you
suddenly found yourself in possession of a military secret which
would end the war immediately in favor of Germany if the Germans
knew it. Would you give this decisive military secret to the
Germans?” Jean answered, “Yes, of course I would.” “But wouldn’t
that be treason?” I asked. “Not at all,” Jean answered. “It wouldn’t
be treason to France; it would only be a blow at what I consider
the treasonable government of the Republic.” Now I submit that
even our rabid isolationists would reject a position like Jean’s,
but we ought nevertheless clearly to see the fact that Lindbergh
and Wheeler by their powerful discouragement of the whole war
effort of America are doing this country the same kind of harm
that came to France.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>In what other ways do we compare with the French?</em></p>

<p>A. It is astonishing to see how many points of similarity we can
discover, beginning with the well-known Maginot line complex
which we parallel with our Atlantic Ocean complex. I remember
back in 1930 at a cocktail party in Berlin a German Lieutenant
Colonel remarked to me about the Maginot line, which the French
were just completing: “That line of fortifications will be the death
of France. If soldiers have such an impregnable fortress to live in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
they will never willingly leave it to take the offensive, and without
taking the offensive you can’t win a war. The Maginot line will
give the French Army a permanent defense complex and out of its
sense of security we will eventually defeat it.” Our complacency
behind the Atlantic Ocean, which we fondly fancy could always
protect us from attack, is precisely the same as the French had.
The French also were brought down by their skepticism; they had
ceased to have any faith in anything, whether the Republic, or
democracy, or God, just as millions of Americans lack faith in
anything and think it smart to deride any kind of ideals, particularly
anything so old-fashioned as sacrifice for one’s country.</p>

<p>The French had up to the bitter end, so little primitive, full-blooded
spirit that they neither sang on the way to battle nor
cursed while in action; they harbored no anger toward the enemy,
no hatred for him, and they had no will to kill. They were apologetic
for being at war, until catastrophe was upon them, and it
was too late. Most Americans feel apologetic about the war and
behave as though they were not sure of the rightness of our cause.</p>

<p>Another curious and not unimportant item of coincidence is
that there was a strong current of anti-British feeling in France at
the beginning of the war, just as there is here. In France it was
grounded largely in the argument, which had much truth in it,
that Great Britain had been largely responsible for the war by her
shortsighted support of Germany against France for so many
years, and that the British would “fight to the last Frenchman.”
This latter argument seemed silly to me when I first met it early
in the Battle of France, at the front near Sedan where I picked up
a little printed leaflet in French, dropped by German aviators.</p>

<p>It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Where is Tommy? The units of the British army which
had occupied certain sectors of the Maginot line were immediately
withdrawn after the beginning of the German offensive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
They were transported as quickly as possible in the
direction of the Channel. For political reasons it was necessary
to conceal this movement, so it was carried out at night.
Nevertheless the population of Lorraine could observe easily
enough that the English were retiring, and in various cities
and towns hostile demonstrations took place against them.
Several times the police and French troops had to intervene
to calm the crowds and suppress the demonstrations.
<em>French Soldiers!</em> You see how the English are trying to get
out just as they did in Norway. <em>They are taking ‘English
leave.’</em> They are leaving you alone on the battlefield. Are
you stupid enough to die for those who are quitting you to
save their precious skins? You had better give the English the
answer they deserve for having betrayed you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now there was not a word of truth in this propaganda about
trouble between British troops and French civilians, and I thought
the leaflet far too crude to have any effect, but I was mistaken; it
corresponded to the unreasoning feeling of many Frenchmen that
the French Army was bearing all the burden. They particularly
resented the fact that whereas at the beginning of the war the
French mobilized all men from twenty to forty-seven years old,
the British at first mobilized only those from twenty to twenty-five
years old. The British Fleet, the French knew theoretically, was
just as important for beating Hitler as the French Army, but the
British Fleet was far away and its actions were unobserved. Just
so today in America we all know theoretically that the presence
of the British Fleet in the Atlantic is imperative for our safety, but
the British Fleet is far away, and so even when we are sending supplies
to the British Fleet and other arms standing between us and
our enemy, many Americans think of it as “aiding Britain,” and
feel quite unselfish about it.</p>

<p>A minor group in America also persists in blaming the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
so heavily for their now amply admitted and fully atoned faults
of the past, that some of them would almost rather see Munich revenged
by German troops in England than have America defend
herself there. Finally we have our anti-British Americans
of Irish origin who consider Oliver Cromwell more blameworthy
than Hitler, although all Irish-Americans are not so purblind by
any means. Taking it all in all, however, I should say that there is
an even stronger anti-British sentiment in America today than
there was in France during the war, and this when coupled to the
broader anti-Europe feeling of a great many Americans, increases
the difficulty of our acting realistically against a powerful enemy
who is taking every advantage of these enfeebling prejudices of
ours.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>You have named so many similarities between ourselves and
the French that it is discouraging indeed, but we have one undeniable
advantage of a large population, and we surely are not
obsessed by our birth rate.</em></p>

<p>A. It is true that we do not worry about our birth rate, although
perhaps we ought to, but we suffer just the same from something
very much like the French obsession with theirs. It was the French
preoccupation with their inferiority in numbers, and their falling
birth rate, which prevented them not merely from wasting lives,
but even from using them thriftily on the battlefield, and the result
was the debacle. During the Battle of France I seldom saw Colonel
Schieffer, in the French Ministry of Information, that he did not
exclaim, “We cannot bleed like this again. Twice in a generation
is too much. We have only twenty million Frenchmen. This time
we must make an end of the Boches so they can never empty our
veins again.” The Colonel, who was personally most warlike, was
under the impression we all had that the French Army was losing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
lives heavily, and he was willing that it be done to prevent ever
again such bloodshed in the future, yet as a matter of fact, the
impulse to save French lives had already become so strong in the
Army High Command that it governed all great decisions and
contributed seriously to the defeat.</p>

<p>Now despite the fact that we are a nation of 130,000,000 we
are obsessed to an equal degree with the fear of having to fight
in large numbers; we have what amounts to a phobia against sending
an American Expeditionary Force to Europe. We seem not
to mind nearly so much the idea of American boys in the Navy
or the Air Force fighting and dying abroad, but when it comes to
the Army we recoil at the idea of an A.E.F. Why the life of an
infantryman should be more precious than that of an aviator or
sailor is not clear. The explanation of this attitude must be found
in the comparative numbers of men involved.</p>

<p>A.E.F. brings up the idea of millions of American boys laying
down their lives on the battlefield, and most Americans completely
forget, if they ever did know, that although we had 4,355,000 men
mobilized during the last war, the total number of them killed in
action and died of wounds received in action was 50,475. This is
roughly one-half of the number of persons killed by accident in
the United States every year. We nevertheless erected in every
village and city of the land large expensive monuments to our war
dead, and the impression became indelibly fixed in the American
mind that we had lost millions, or at any rate hundreds of thousands
of dead. The vision of this mass sacrifice of American youth
is what moves the American people to reject so violently the
idea of an expeditionary force. We ought now to be adult enough
to see that our penurious attitude toward our precious American
blood reflects the same feeling as the French, with more justification,
had toward their birth rate, and that if persisted in, this attitude
will lead us to similar disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Aren’t there any encouraging differences between ourselves and
the unfortunate French?</em></p>

<p>A. I am glad to say there are, and enough, I devoutly hope, to
save us from their fate. We have a leader; the French had none.
We are not divided as badly as the French were divided. Despite
the fierceness of our political passions, it would be a very exceptional
American indeed who would say, “I’d rather have Hitler
than Roosevelt,” as so many Frenchmen used to say, “We’d rather
have Hitler than Leon Blum.” We are physically a healthier people
than the French. There is hardly one of the weaknesses now perceptible
in the American people that would not be swept away by
the fact of our going to war, but there is hardly one of them which
can be removed by any other means.</p>

<p>The most encouraging difference between the French and American
democracies is the quality and character of our newspapers.
American newspapers bring to their readers today a greater volume
of news, of greater accuracy, than has ever been delivered to an
audience of newspaper readers in the history of the world. It has
been my job for nearly two decades to study the newspapers of a
score of countries, not superficially but with the businesslike object
of gleaning news. I had to read thirty-two German newspapers a
day when I was correspondent in Berlin; and a dozen or so daily
in Paris. It is no exaggeration to say that the reader of the <cite>New
York Times</cite>, or the <cite>New York Herald-Tribune</cite>, or the <cite>Chicago
Daily News</cite>, or any one of half a dozen of our great metropolitan
dailies, has more detailed and true information about what is going
on in the world than if he were able by magic to accumulate all
the newspapers published everywhere else on earth, and were able
equally by magic to read them all in the original.</p>

<p>Often I am asked, “How can we know the truth? Everything is
so confusing. Aren’t we fed with propaganda?” The answer is you
can know the truth by reading your newspapers thoroughly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
exercising common sense in balancing the reports from the belligerent
countries against each other.</p>

<p>No war has ever been fought in such a blazing light of information.
Never has such a quantity of news been put before a people
as we Americans have before us at breakfast every day and from
then on until midnight. American newspapers are doing today the
most superb job ever done by daily journals. But that is not their
chief merit. Their chief merit is their honesty and incorruptibility
and their sincere endeavor to be fair and objective. These qualities
have enabled the American press, since the foundation of the
United States, to be the equal in importance to the executive or
the legislative or the judicial branch of government. It is the vigilant
watchman over the functioning of the other three branches
of government.</p>

<p>In no other country has the newspaperman the rights and privileges
that he has here. He is as important for the preservation of
our liberties and our security as any legislator, judge, or executive.
One can almost formulate a law that one can judge the quality of
a democracy and its expectancy of life by its press. By that standard
France was doomed to fall. France under the Republic had the
most venal newspapers on earth. As the American press is honest,
so was the French press dishonest. The French government was a
faithful reflection of its press, one might say almost a creation of
its press. Some good Frenchmen even go so far as to lay the major
responsibility for the fall of France on their newspapers whose
editorial opinions for the most part were as plainly for sale as the
vegetables in the market.</p>

<p>The reasons for their venality go back to the period at the end
of the nineteenth century when all the states of Europe were floating
government loans in Paris, the banking center of the continent.
The French peasant, who kept his gold in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bas de laine</i>, his
woolen stocking, was the chief investor, and the French newspapers
were the chief salesmen. Profits from the flotation were so enormous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
that the governments concerned could afford to pay very
large bribes to the French newspapers to recommend their bonds.
The French peasants at that time believed their newspapers, bought
the bonds, and the corrupt newspapers grew rich and content.
This easy money made it unnecessary for them to go out and get
advertising, and from that day to this French newspapers have
lacked the economic foundation that American newspapers have.
After the war, the bribes from financial quarters largely disappeared
and the French newspapers, without advertising, and with the
habit of venality, became more unscrupulous, because hungrier
than ever. French newspapermen, worse paid than ever, were
reduced to selling their services cheaper than ever before, and the
corruption became almost universal.</p>

<p>One famous French correspondent was fired by his famous newspaper
because he had taken a bribe from a foreign government&mdash;and
had failed to split it with the managing editor. Hardly a
newspaper in Paris would refuse a subsidy from a foreign government,
but all this giving and taking of bribes became trivial when
Hitler came to power in 1933. From then on the French press was
inundated with German money, and from then on could be dated
the certainty that France would fall.</p>

<p>I want above all things to emphasize that there were a few honest,
capable, patriotic, and incorruptible French journalists. It is sufficient
commentary on the Vichy government that most of them
had to flee when the Germans came.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is there any hope for the French? Do you think they can come
back?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, because they have learned to hate; the Germans have
taught them. I know it sounds most un-Christian to insist upon the
necessity of hatred, but the thoughtful will remember that Christ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
hated evil, and when he scourged the money-changers from the
Temple he did it with fury. Who will dispute that Hitler is more
evil than money-changers in a Temple, and that all the forces of
Christianity ought to be ranged together to destroy his hateful
power. You cannot win a battle, you cannot win a war, you cannot
win any kind of fight that involves killing unless you have the
spirit to kill. You cannot have that spirit unless you are convinced
of the justice of your cause, and you know that God is on your
side, and that God approves your killing your enemies.</p>

<p>The French never had any such spirit during the war, except
perhaps at the very end, but they have it now. During the war they
were all the time debating in their hearts whether it would not be
better to quit and make friends with the Germans. They thought
in terms of the last war. They thought of the Germans as the same
sort of human beings as the Germans of 1870 or of 1914-1918.
They simply failed to grasp the most important fact in the world
of international affairs today, namely that the Nazi Germans under
Hitler are a new species of creature never seen before in modern
times, a deliberately amoral species of men who reject every tenet
of Christianity or of any other religion which enjoins kindness,
truth, and justice, and who are possessed of such unique talents for
war that they could conceivably achieve their ambition to conquer
the world if they were not stopped by a coalition of all the decent
peoples on earth. The French above all failed to take seriously
Hitler’s cool, considered statement that he intended to exterminate
France as a nation.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How about the treatment Hitler has given France so far; he
hasn’t tried to exterminate them, has he?</em></p>

<p>A. No, but Hitler is not through with the French; he has not even
begun to treat them the way he intends to ultimately. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
several reasons why he has been comparatively lenient to France
so far. First, he wished to end French resistance immediately in
order that the whole force of the German Army might be thrown
at England. Second, he wished to lull the French into a belief that
by collaborating with the Germans they might obtain the “honorable
peace” Pétain talks about. Third, he wished to make it appear
to the British and eventually to the Americans that surrender to
Hitler is not so bad. Finally, he wished to get from the Vichy government
several important things he either did not dare demand
or was refused at the Compiègne armistice, chiefly that the French
should go to war against Britain or at any rate turn over the
French fleet and naval bases to the Germans for use against the
British.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do you imply that later on Hitler’s treatment of France will
be different?</em></p>

<p>A. I do indeed. He will eventually fulfill the one principle which
has guided his foreign policy more than any other; to destroy the
power of France <em>ever</em> to threaten Germany again. How could any
Frenchman forget the words of Hitler in <cite>Mein Kampf</cite> when he
wrote: “We must at last become entirely clear about this: the
German people’s irreconcilable mortal enemy is and remains
France”? And again: “The political testament of the German nation
... must read substantially: See an attack on Germany in any
attempt to organize a military power [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, France] on the frontiers
of Germany, be it only in the form of the creation of a state
capable of becoming a military power [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, France] and in that
case regard it not only a right but a duty to prevent the establishment
of such a state [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, France] by all means including the application
of armed force, or in the event that such a one be already
founded, to repress it.” So you see what the fate of France is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
bound to be, now that she has given up her arms and her will to
fight.</p>

<p>If left alone her fate will surely be that defined by Churchill in
his address to the French people while Vichy still hesitated: “I
tell you truly and what you must believe when I say this evil man,
this monstrous abortion of hatred and deceit, has resolved on nothing
less than the complete wiping out of the French nation and
the disintegration of its whole life and future. By all kinds of sly
and savage means he is plotting and working to crush forever the
fountain of characteristic French culture and French inspiration to
the world. It is not defeat that France will now be made to suffer
at German hands, but the doom of complete obliteration. Army,
navy, air force, religions, laws, language, culture, institutions, literature,
history, tradition, all are to be effaced by the brute strength
of a triumphant army and the scientific low cunning of a ruthless
Police Force.”</p>

<p>This is true. This will be the fate of France unless the United
States and Britain and Russia defeat Hitler. Of course so long as
the French under the men of Vichy remain the strictly obedient
vassal, Hitler will have no need for sharper measures until the time
comes for him to shape France into her ultimate permanent role of
coolie agricultural colony of the Reich.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What did Hitler promise Pétain?</em></p>

<p>A. He promised that if Pétain would sign the armistice, very soon
afterward he would give France a permanent and just peace, that
German troops would evacuate France, and in the New Order of
Europe Germany would help France become a free and independent
partner. All this was, however, tacitly contingent on the
defeat of Britain. The German excuse for not freeing France now
is that the battle against Russia and Britain is still going on. France<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
meanwhile is compelled to suffer in a slavery worse than she ever
suffered in her entire national history.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What do you mean by the term “slavery”? The French people
are not being driven about in slave gangs, are they, with an overseer
carrying a black-snake whip and all that as in</em> Uncle Tom’s
Cabin<em>? I understood the Germans were behaving very “correctly.”</em></p>

<p>A. It is true that only the prisoners of war, who still number about
a million and a half, are in this literal, physical sense enslaved.
The rest of the French people, though, are just as much the slaves
of the Germans as if they were housed in slave pens and driven
to work in chains. Why? Because they must give up to their
German masters all the fruits of their labors except a bare subsistence.
The French people have been paying the Germans an
indemnity of roughly ten million dollars a day, or $3,650,000,000
a year, and with this money the Germans have been buying from
the French, who are forced to sell, all the property of any value in
the country, from objects of art to great industrial plants. Consider
the size of this indemnity. The maximum yearly reparations payment
Germany had to make after the last war was $600,000,000.
That is one sixth of what the French have had to pay in the first
twelve months of German rule in this war.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How was this indemnity fixed?</em></p>

<p>A. In the armistice agreement which Pétain so trustfully signed,
it was stipulated that the French would pay for the cost of maintaining
the German Army in France. No sum was named. You
can imagine the astonishment of the French when, after they had
laid down their arms and there was no possibility of refusing, they
learned they had to pay the Germans 400,000,000 francs, or
roughly $10,000,000 a day. It will give you some notion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
difference between the old-fashioned German conqueror and the
new-fashioned Nazi to recollect that after the Franco-German
War of 1870 Bismarck exacted a <em>total</em> indemnity of $1,250,000,000,
or one-third of what the French of today are forced to pay <em>yearly</em>.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How does this French payment compare with the total amounts
Germany paid for reparation after the last war?</em></p>

<p>A. The maximum estimate of German reparations payments in
cash and kind is about $5,000,000,000, which is almost precisely
the amount of money Americans lent Germany and never got
back. It is the literal truth that Germany paid no reparations. The
United States paid them. I was a correspondent in Germany during
all those crucial years from the French occupation of the Ruhr
onward, and most of us who were on the spot agree that despite
the dislocation of wealth in Germany the country as a whole had
not lost wealth through payment of reparations, since for every
dollar that went to France or England, an American dollar came in.</p>

<p>All critics of the Versailles treaty insist that its worst feature
was the reparations, but if you keep in mind the fundamental fact
that the Germans borrowed (and never repaid) every cent they
used to meet the reparations claims, the Versailles treaty and the
German complaints about it take on a very different aspect. This
is so important that it cannot be overemphasized, because one of
the principal reasons why the United States withdrew from the
peace and why England and eventually France relaxed their vigilance
and permitted Germany to arm and grow into the terrible
power she is today, was the feeling that the Germans after all had
been treated unjustly.</p>

<p>You could make a case for the argument that our own “guilt
complex” about Versailles allowed Hitler to tear up the treaty and
finally attack the world. Paul Birdsall has pointed out that this
“guilt complex” received powerful encouragement from John
Maynard Keynes, who correctly analyzed the economic impossibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
of the reparations clauses, but went on from there to condemn
the whole treaty as a Carthaginian peace. It has taken Hitler,
who climbed to power on his denunciation of Versailles, to show
us how lenient a peace it was.</p>

<p>Remembering that the Germans actually paid no reparations, it
is instructive to examine what they formally paid in comparison
with what they are now extorting from the French. The Allies at
the London conference in April 1921 fixed their demands on Germany
for “damage done to civilians” at $33,000,000,000&mdash;which at
the time was considered insanely high, but incidentally is $11,000,000,000
less than the $44,000,000,000 the United States has
now appropriated and recommended for national defense. Isn’t
this a startling confirmation of the mistake the American Congress
made in repudiating the League of Nations and refusing to ratify
the security treaty with England and France?</p>

<p>It is fantastic to realize that we could have paid the entire bill
for the last war and if by so doing we could have prevented this
war, we would still have saved money. We will eventually learn
that the isolationists’ or appeasers’ program for America is not
only the most dangerous but infinitely the most costly. France
has certainly learned how true this is.</p>

<p><em>At the rate they are now paying, the French will have paid the
Germans in about seventeen months an amount equivalent to all
the reparations payments ($5,000,000,000) made by the Germans
with American money in the twelve years during which the Germans
pretended to pay.</em> They stopped even the pretense of payment
you remember after the Lausanne Conference in 1932, even
before Hitler came to power. This immense indemnity the French
are paying now is merely an interim payment for the alleged cost
of maintaining the German Army. Actually the cost of maintaining
the army is estimated to be not 400,000,000 but 125,000,000
francs, so that the Germans have a surplus of 275,000,000 francs
or around $7,000,000 for their daily “purchases.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why did the Germans select the figure 400,000,000 francs
daily?</em></p>

<p>A. Because this was the amount the French were spending on
the war. In their 1940 war budget they allocated 106 billion francs
to the air force, 36 billion to the army, and 15 billion to the navy,
making a total of 157 billion, which is roughly 400,000,000 francs
a day. Hitler reckoned if the French could afford to spend this
sum on fighting the Germans, they could spend the same amount
to feed, clothe, transport, lodge, amuse, and otherwise support the
Germans as they are doing now.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But if the French were spending this much money on the war
anyway, how are they economically worse off by continuing the
same expenditure?</em></p>

<p>A. They are incomparably worse off because formerly the proceeds
of this sum were consumed by Frenchmen; today they are
consumed by Germans. The money formerly circulated throughout
the French economic body as healthy blood; today it is sucked
and swallowed by the vast German leech. Furthermore the French
expenditure on the war did not cease with their defeat; they still
have large expenses besides their tribute to Germany.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What means do the Germans use to buy up French businesses?
Why don’t the French refuse to sell?</em></p>

<p>A. Some of them do, but the Germans always have the power to
force them to sell.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why do the Germans bother to go through the form of buying,
if they can confiscate whatever they want?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span></p>

<p>A. Because they can get what they want with much less trouble
and in better shape and be able to make better use of it if they
go through the form of purchase. They had their whole system
of plundering France worked out before the war. During the
prewar period thousands of Germans crisscrossed France, as tourists
or traveling salesmen. They located the most desirable industrial
or other properties, nearly all, incidentally, in the rich
Northern half now Occupied France. When the Germans came in
they rushed a specially trained corps of experts to all the banks
and business houses, embargoed banking transactions and ordered
every security holder in France to give a list of his property. Soon
they knew the precise financial position of every important corporation
or individual in France. With this knowledge they were
able to buy into the control of all the businesses they wanted.
Sometimes if the French owner refused to sell, the Germans could
make the owner’s bank foreclose on his loan and thus force the
owner to raise money by selling a share of his business. The Germans
were modest; usually they wanted only 51 per cent. Sometimes
the Germans would withhold raw materials from a stubborn
industrialist. Sometimes the German authorities forcibly confiscated
the property; just often enough to remind Frenchmen that,
if they liked, the Germans could take every machine, sack of flour,
and stick of furniture in the country without recompense.</p>

<p>Another most effective weapon used by the Germans to force
the French to sell their businesses is the German edict that all
concerns, from shops to factories, must remain open and keep their
full roll of employees. Since almost no business is being done, and
most concerns would normally have closed, this rule drives most
businessmen into bankruptcy, as it was intended to do. By these
and other similar means, the Germans, using the francs paid them
by the French, have gone far toward buying “legal” control of
the most valuable property in France. With appalling swiftness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
the French people are being pauperized and reduced to slaves in
what used to be their own homes.</p>

<p>They are like the Negroes on a pre-Civil War plantation in our
own South. The Germans, like the white folks, live in the big
house, eat caviar and chicken, drink the wonderful wines of
France, clothe their women with the creations of the great
couturiers, and promenade the Boulevards while the French people,
half-starving, broken, humiliated, work desperately hard to support
their masters. The French are now not even being treated as well
as slaves under a master considerate enough to wish to keep his
slaves in good health and fit working order. I should think it would
be fair to say that out of an eight-hour day the Frenchman today
has to devote four hours to working for the Germans.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>If these are the interim armistice terms imposed on France,
what will the final terms of peace be like?</em></p>

<p>A. You can be sure that the German demands will be limited only
by the total wealth of France. We know Hitler intends the total
productive wealth of the country to pass into German hands.
Without waiting for peace, the Germans are, as we noted, already
systematically stripping France of her movable valuables and taking
them to Germany, and buying control of the immovable
property they want. But if the time ever comes, when Hitler
makes a so-called peace with France, we may expect that he will
take pleasure in basing his demands partly on the Versailles treaty.</p>

<p>He will first demand that the reparations Germany paid after
the last war be paid back; then he will demand full compensation
for the German merchant and fishing fleets, and the railroad equipment,
cattle, etc., turned over to the Allies after the last war to
make up for similar items seized by the Germans; he will demand
replacement of all the shipping Germany was compelled to build
for the Allies to take the place of the ships sunk by the Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
Navy; he will bill the Allies for the coal Germany delivered the
Allies to replace the coal taken from the mines of Northern France
during the war. After the broad category of claims from the last
war has been put down, Hitler will then ask for reparations for
this war, and of course he can set any sum he likes.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But why should Hitler take so much trouble to claim formal
reparations? Since he obviously intends permanently to cripple
his victim, why should he bother to go through the legalistic form
of itemizing his claims?</em></p>

<p>A. Because that is the way Hitler and his Nazis always do things.
The German, even the Nazi, is an orderly fellow. The first principle
of all Germans is “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ordnung muss sein.</i>” Aside from that, or
above it, is the fact that Hitler, deeply conscious of the illegality
of all his actions, beginning with the seizure of power, has always
insisted on clothing everything he does with the appearance of
lawfulness. When he seized power he did it by banning the Communist
and then the Socialist parties from the Reichstag, and thus
obtaining a majority vote in the Reichstag. Whenever he attacks
a nation he announces a long list of reasons, backed sometimes by
an extraordinary array of documents, many of them forged, to
prove he not only had a right to attack but was compelled to do
so.</p>

<p>This necessity for self-justification explains also one of the
queerest Nazi practices in their torture chambers. When they
have finished torturing a victim, they invariably make him sign a
statement testifying that he had been well treated. One would
think since the Nazi power is absolute, they would not care, or
bother to take this trouble, but they seem to be under a profound
compulsion to make this gesture toward the justice they have in
practice abolished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What is the use of our maintaining diplomatic relations with
Vichy? In view of all that you have said I should think we ought
to withdraw our recognition of Vichy and transfer it to de Gaulle
and the Free French.</em></p>

<p>A. I suppose the chief reason we do not break diplomatic relations
with Vichy is the same reason why we have not broken formal
relations with Germany: in both cases we wish to keep a diplomatic
observer on the scene. That is understandable in the case of
Germany, since we are only formally at peace with her, and are
morally at war and all the world knows it. In other words, until
we begin to shoot, it would not make much difference whether we
broke relations with Germany or not. But in the case of Vichy,
it would make a world of difference if we took our recognition
away from Pétain and gave it to de Gaulle. It is true that de Gaulle
is actually in control of only some central African French territory
while Pétain nominally rules all France, but we have continued
our recognition of all the governments in exile and refused any
kind of recognition to the Quislings and Rexists, and in this spirit
we ought to withdraw our recognition from Pétain. It would
immensely hearten the Free French to have our recognition and
if we extended Lease-Lend aid to de Gaulle’s forces it could have
important military consequences. However, I suppose Washington
is still hoping against hope that we may one day be able to gain
some profit from having treated Pétain as well as we have. I personally
do not believe we ever will.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">6. THE UNITED STATES</h2>
</div>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What is the greatest danger we face as a nation?</em></p>

<p>A. Our complacency. It is colossal, cosmic, suicidal.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Can you still call us complacent after we have conscripted an
Army, begun to create an Air Force, gone far toward building a
two-ocean Navy, flung a line of outposts from Iceland to South
America, appropriated and recommended fifty billion dollars for
defense, and told our Navy to sink German fighting ships?</em></p>

<p>A. The very list you name reeks with complacency. All of that put
together does not equal a week of what even the “despised” Russians
are doing now. The bitterest thing yet said about us was:
“Better a Bolshevik who kills Germans than a Democrat who kills
time.” We still unwaveringly and unblushingly expect somebody
else to do the job for us. Now it is Russia.</p>

<p>To begin with we said France and England would do the job;
then Norway; then the Low Countries; then the Balkans; and now
we sit back and actually rely on the Russians. We cheer the news
that the Navy is going to fight but shrink at the idea of an American
Expeditionary Force. Why? For the same reason that war with
Japan has many more advocates than war with Germany, because
we could leave a sea war to the professional fighting men of the
Navy. We shirk calling things by their proper names. Never have
we used so many weasel words. Conscripts are “selectees”; naval
war is “hunting pirates”; hiring the British to do our fighting for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
us is “lease-lend”; isolationists become “noninterventionists”; interventionists
argue tediously for “all-out aid,” but few of them ever
come out plainly and say we ought to go to war. All of this evasion
stems from the refusal to face the supreme reality, namely that
we have to go to war, that it is our war and was our war from the
beginning.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But haven’t we gone far toward recognizing that it is our war
by our lease-lend appropriations of around thirteen billion dollars?</em></p>

<p>A. Do you realize that we actually delivered only $190,000,000
worth of goods in the first six months of lease-lend to Britain and
China? That is only a little over one per cent of the total lease-lend
money involved. If it takes us six months to deliver one per cent,
how long will it take to deliver 100 per cent? Certainly, the beginning
is slowest; certainly speed of deliveries will increase almost
geometrically after the new factories begin to produce. But the
fact is that we will never produce enough to win this war without
going formally to war. As Donald M. Nelson, chief defense buyer,
suggested, the only way to get capacity production for armaments
is to make the program so big that civilian needs will be irresistibly
pushed into the background, and every factory capable of producing
armaments will be forced to drop its civilian business and
go immediately to work on war materials.</p>

<p>What does “pushing our civilian needs into the background”
mean? It means sacrifice; it means a lowering of our standard of
living. Do you know anyone, have you a single person in your
acquaintance in civilian life, whose standard of living has deteriorated
as a result of sacrifice for our so-called defense effort? Leaf
through your smart magazines, read the news of the shops, and
ask yourself what the fighting folk of Europe would think of the
war effort of a country whose rugged males in the bloody autumn
of 1941 are asked in full-page advertisements: “Have you seen the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
new brown diamonds for men? These interesting, subdued stones
are rapidly becoming a major item in the well-dressed man’s wardrobe.”
Would this make very good evidence against Hitler’s assertion
that we are a “decadent, degenerate democracy not to be
taken seriously in war”?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But how can we expect to improve morale by criticism? Isn’t
it true that if you tell a healthy man he looks ill, and tell him frequently
enough, he may actually fall ill?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, but if you tell an ill man he looks well, and he therefore
fails to take care of himself, he may die. It is not fear that we need;
it is awareness. What was the common cause of the death of the
fifteen nations which have fallen to Hitler? It was lack of awareness
of his threat to their national existence. From Poland to Greece
they were all overconfident and hence for six long years did
nothing to bring about that coalition which might have saved
them. Overconfidence is our danger, not defeatism. The moment
our Navy was given orders to convoy and shoot, one prominent
voice was raised to suggest that now we might diminish our Army,
as though the war were virtually won.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Our morale is very bad, then?</em></p>

<p>A. No, that is not true. Our morale is high. That sounds like a
contradiction but it is not. It is my conviction after talking to
audiences all over the country that the American people are eager
to find out the truth and when they hear it they are eager to act;
that they are far ahead of their leaders in Congress, and even of the
President; and that if the President wanted it, he could get directly
from the American people, not from Congress, but from the
twenty-seven million Americans who voted for him, plus many
million more, approval of any measure he advocated, including a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
formal declaration of war. National morale depends so much on
leadership that a great figure, as Roosevelt in this country and
Churchill in England, can influence it to great decisions with one
broadcast.</p>

<p>But without leadership we soon sink back into smug apathy, and
the kind of thoughtlessness which led Americans in the first six
months of 1941 to buy 35 per cent more automobiles, 42 per cent
more refrigerators, and 51 per cent more electric ranges than in the
same period of 1940&mdash;all of these luxury articles being built of
materials vital for our defense industry. The French too, right up
to the collapse, went on eating tremendous meals, loafing behind
their Maginot line, and reading illustrated magazines with pictures
just like ours showing magnificent fleets of planes and tanks. An
unwitting reader of some of our great periodicals would get the
impression that we have one of the world’s most powerful tank
armies and that our warplanes could darken the skies. We lay
down the magazine with a sigh of content. Good old U.S.A. We
knew we could do it. What was all that talk about unpreparedness?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Haven’t we a tank army?</em></p>

<p>A. We have four armored divisions now being organized. We see
them under such titles as “Uncle Sam’s Mighty Tanks Move Into
Action,” and only the closest examination of the picture reveals
that most of the tanks are armored cars. In 1940 we produced 20
light, no medium, and no heavy tanks a month; in 1941, 260 light,
130 medium, and no heavy tanks a month; and in 1942 we shall
produce 390 light, 300 medium, and still no heavy tanks a month.
I quote from an authoritative release of July 4, 1941: “None of
the four existing armored divisions is regarded as complete and
ready for combat on the European scale because medium and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
heavy tanks have not arrived yet, and because <em>coordinated practice
with the air arm regularly attached to the divisions has not yet
been possible</em> and because much of the training time must be
devoted to the basic training of new men.” There is the mechanized
force of the United States of America in the third year of the
mechanized world war. Our armored strength consists of light
tanks only, completely useless against heavy or medium tanks. But
most appalling is the revelation that this late in a war in which
every victory has been won by the famous dive bomber plus tank
team, we seem not to possess any such team at all, for that must be
the meaning of the statement that there has been no practice of
coordination between planes and tanks. These teams cannot be
improvised. An army without them today is like an army would
have been without artillery yesterday.</p>

<p>In effect we still do not possess an effective armored force and
the production figures indicate we shall not have one in 1942
either, for until we have heavy tanks we cannot face heavy tanks.
What have the Germans in the way of mechanized armament? We
cannot tell what changes have taken place since the Battle of
Russia began, but we know that their losses are constantly replenished
from the industrial plants of all Europe now working feverishly
for the Germans. At the Battle of France the Germans had
ten Panzer divisions and it was these steel hack saws which cut the
body of France into bleeding ribbons and ended the French nation
in five weeks. The Germans captured from the French 4,000 or
5,000 tanks and since that time have produced incessantly until it
is estimated that they entered the Battle of Russia with a total of
20 to 30 Panzer divisions and with at least 25,000 tanks. The German
Army is obviously the army we are preparing to fight. Its
armored strength is conservatively estimated about twenty-five
times ours, and it has more than two years of battle experience.
We not only have not got an army that could take part in modern
warfare at all, but we are not even preparing to create such an
army. We may get one. We will get one if we have time. We will
get an army if we go to war in time to keep the British between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
us and our enemy for the period it will take to build an army. We
will never get an army so long as we are satisfied with what we
have.</p>

<p>We American people have been like a neurotic who refuses to
listen to bad news; who will not go to a physician for fear of what
he may find out. We could afford to view the matter less darkly
if it appeared that our production would give us an effective fighting
machine sometime in the future, but this does not seem to be
the case. Our gun production indicates that we expect to be ready
to fight a modern army sometime around the 1950’s. It shows that
in the middle of 1941 we had a production of 4 big, 29 medium,
and 20 small antiaircraft guns per month. At that rate it would take
a year to make enough antiaircraft guns to guard New York City
alone. In mid-1942 we shall, if we are lucky, have a production of
22 big, 23 medium, and 300 small antiaircraft guns monthly. At
this rate we should be able properly to guard the large cities of the
Eastern seaboard in about ten years.</p>

<p>In 1941 we did not produce any 155 mm. cannon, but we will
make fourteen of them monthly in 1942; just as we produced no
105 mm. cannon in 1940, but put out 22 per month in 1941 and in
1942 hope to make 155 a month. At this rate we ought to be able
to finish enough artillery to match the German artillery in about
1951. We are still turning out 37 mm. antitank guns, although tests
have shown that this gun will not penetrate the armor of the tanks
it would have to meet. Even our famous Garand rifle apparently
cannot be manufactured anything like fast enough to supply the
growing army. In mid-1941 it was being turned out at the rate of
22,500 a month; and in 1942 it is due to be produced at the rate of
52,000 a month. That is only 624,000 a year. At this rate it would
take well over three years to equip the two-million-man army
which is our initial goal in the face of the fact that the forces it is
being built to meet number upward of ten million.</p>

<p>In airplanes we have the one advantage that we came so late into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
the field that we have few obsolescent types. The British and Germans
have the immense advantage of daily contact with battle
experience. In mid-1941 we produced 206 fighters and 60 bombers
per month for ourselves and sent an average of 390 planes monthly
to Britain. Our aid to Britain, “all out, short of war,” amounted to
this, that after two years of war we were sending Britain about
one-eighth as many warplanes as Germany’s production, believed
to be around 3,000 a month. Even in 1942 when we shall have
reached capacity production, we expect to send Britain only 650
planes a month, and to make only 600 bombers and 600 fighters
monthly for ourselves. That is, even in the third year of war we
propose to have a production of only about three-quarters the
German production. We have pitched our sights far too low. We
might as well quit if we cannot set the sights up.</p>

<p>Raymond Swing always tells me as he rakes in the pot, “Knick,
it is not good hands that win in poker; it is better hands.” So it is
in this war. We shall never win with a good army, navy, and air
force; they have to be better than the enemy’s and bigger too.
Before the Battle of Russia some military critics held that we did
not need even the 1,500,000 men we now have under arms; that we
needed only a highly mechanized force. Now we see that to win
in this war an army needs mass as well as machines. As yet we have
neither.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why haven’t we at any rate planned an adequate army of four
or five million men with at least as many armored divisions as the
Germans?</em></p>

<p>A. Because to plan an adequate army would indicate we intended
to go to war. To make it big enough and well enough equipped to
fight the Germans would indicate that we intended to fight the
Germans. The consequence of our ostrich hypocrisy, our faint-hearted
catering to the pacifist, isolationist-obscurantist bloc is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
we not only do not but we cannot build an army to perform the
function for which it was called into existence: fight the Nazis.
If we equip it to go abroad, up go cries of alarm from the Wheeler-Lindbergh
crowd: “Foreign war! See, the President is going to
put us into a foreign war!”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But if we have nothing to fight with, how can we go to war?</em></p>

<p>A. Only by going to war can we guarantee the continued existence
of the British fighting machine and the control of the Atlantic
by the British Navy and our own. As long as the Atlantic is thus
controlled we can arm ourselves in safety.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But why can’t we arm ourselves, as we are now doing, without
going to war, and after we are thoroughly prepared, then, if it is
still necessary, go in and win? Wouldn’t that be more sensible?</em></p>

<p>A. No, because until we go to war we shall never arm ourselves
adequately or send to Britain and Russia anything like the supplies
we would send if we went to war. Second, if we do not go to war
at once there exists always the possibility of German victory.
Although the German Army is busy for the time being in Russia,
Hitler knows he has to conquer Britain to win. He intends to
return to the Battle of Britain. The Battle of the Atlantic is constantly
going on. Events move with such lightning speed in this
war that a sudden overwhelming Hitler victory is still quite conceivable.
Beaverbrook only the other day said he was convinced
Hitler still intended to try to invade the British Isles.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do you think Hitler could succeed in invading Britain?</em></p>

<p>A. If Hitler is willing to lose half a million or a million men in a
super-Blitz&mdash;and we know that he is quite willing to invest that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
many more German lives in his dream of 1,000 years of Nazi
Empire&mdash;even British authorities admit he might get a foothold in
England. The German tactics would probably be similar to the
attack on Crete, except that against the British Isles they would
try many more landings by sea. Everything would be on a gigantic
scale. The air bombardment to precede the attempt would surpass
anything experienced in the Blitz of the autumn of 1940 which I
witnessed. In this super-Blitz the Germans would attempt to paralyze
the R.A.F. They were not able to do it before. The R.A.F.,
as Churchill said, won the climacteric victory of the First Battle
of Britain by knocking down three German planes to every one
they lost, and in that fight the Germans outnumbered the British
three to one. But if Hitler gets the airplane factories of Russia, to
add to the production of the French, Czech, Belgian, and Greater
German production, is there anyone who would undertake to
prove that he could not concentrate in one furious attack more
force than even the dauntless R.A.F. could repel?</p>

<p>The Germans can never beat the British but they might suffocate
them. Hitler so far has never used more than 500 or 600 warplanes
in a single attack on England. Suppose he uses 5,000. Why
has he not done this before? Every aviation and military authority
I talked with during the Blitz in England was baffled at this. There
were scores of guesses. The most popular answer now is that the
Germans did not have the airfields from which to launch so many
planes at once. This is a limiting factor in air warfare which is now
given great weight. It is pointed out that it takes a huge airfield to
send off 100 planes. It is even argued that the British are bound to
lose the war eventually because their island can accommodate only
a restricted number of airfields, which fix an upper limit for their
R.A.F., while the Germans can build an indefinitely large force.
Since the First Battle of Britain the Germans have had plenty of
time to build airfields from Norway to France sufficient to take
care of the air fleets of all the world. We know they have built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
many secretly along the coast of Northern France and the Low
Countries. Hitler’s tactic of surprise would lead him to keep them
in reserve for the great invasion. Few observers would exclude the
possibility that the Germans may be able to use thousands of planes
in the Second Battle of Britain where they used hundreds in the
first.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why doesn’t Hitler use poison gas?</em></p>

<p>A. I am convinced he will use it whenever he becomes desperate.
Why has he not used it before? The British know he has vast
quantities of it. He may be afraid of reprisals. When he uses gas
at all I should think it would be in a once-for-all storm. Imagine
what the effect of a giant attack with a heavy gas might be on
London where as many as 4,000,000 persons sleep in underground
shelters. The English have virtually ceased to carry gas
masks. At the beginning of the war not one person in a hundred
appeared on the streets of London without one. Today not one
person in fifty carries one.</p>

<p>Hitler would probably not use gas at all except as a part of a
knockout blow so violent that the British would not have a chance
to strike back. Whatever the outcome, it is possible that such a
mass gas assault might kill hundreds of thousands in one night.
While the gas attack was being poured upon the large cities, in the
hope also of wiping out the government and other leaders in urban
headquarters, swarms of flat-bottomed scows and other vessels
would put out from the coasts of the Channel and the North Sea,
to make for landings at perhaps a dozen different places, anywhere
along the coast of both England and Scotland. Some of these objectives
would be feigned to divert English defense forces from the
real ones, which might number five or six. Meanwhile great numbers
of parachute troops would be landed to capture British airfields
and hold them long enough for troop planes and gliders to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
land reinforcements, and these landings would also be attempted at
the immediate rear of the coastal points where the German troops
were coming in by sea.</p>

<p>British authorities admit that it would be a serious matter if the
Germans could establish one or more such bridgeheads on the coast
and land heavy tanks, for the British even yet are not satisfactorily
equipped with this indispensable weapon. The British believe they
could concentrate and recapture any points seized by the Germans,
but who knows? Crete showed what could be done with air-borne
troops, and although the British Isles would be in most respects
more difficult to capture than Crete, they would not be in all
respects. The Germans are much nearer the British Isles, and
could concentrate many times the force they used on Crete.</p>

<p>If the invasion of Britain ever takes place, Hitler will doubtless
make it a win-the-war or lose-the-war battle, on a scale of the
highest concentrated violence. Neither side will hold back reserves,
as the R.A.F. did even in the worst days of the 1940 Blitz, because
they were waiting to use their last fighters and bombers against the
expected invaders. The British Navy will drive regardless of mines
or submarines through the narrow waters of the Channel to throw
itself between the invaders and the island. The odds would still be
on the British to win, in my judgment. They are in an incomparably
stronger position than in 1940 when after Dunkirk they were
practically weaponless. Today they have two to three million first-class,
well-equipped, and well-trained troops and over a million
Home Guards on the island; their coast defenses, as I have seen on
visits around the island, are formidable and deep; the R.A.F. is
present in full strength on its home bases, and the British claim it
is growing steadily stronger relative to the Luftwaffe; and the
Royal Navy, sallying from its home ports, here has the protection
of air forces which were not available at Crete. Finally, the British
would be defending their homes, and this lends an astonishing
extra strength to fighting men. I would not like to be a member of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
the German Army trying to occupy and pacify England. At the
school of Cad’s Warfare, run by Tom Wintringham outside of
London, they have taught the old fellows and the youngsters in
the Home Guard many odd and useful tricks, from the best way
to strangle a German sentry from behind, to the best way to stab
a German sentry from in front.</p>

<p>Even if the chances are in favor of the British, there are so many
surprises in war, and especially in this war, that it would be folly
for us to behave as though we knew Britain would win without us.
If she falls, we must be prepared to meet the whole German war
machine alone.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Is it true that the Germans once tried to invade Britain and
failed as we heard rumored here?</em></p>

<p>A. I am convinced those rumors were without foundation; I do
not think the Germans have ever tried to invade the British Isles.
I remember the September story. I was in England then and about
mid-September I learned that the highest British authorities believed
the invasion might come at any moment. With the invincible Virginia
Cowles we went “Looking for Trouble” and motored to
Dover and spent a week along the coast, in constant contact with
the British military authorities. We heard not a whisper of the yarn
about invasion until later in London when rumors came from the
continent that the R.A.F. had broken up a fleet of German invasion
vessels and drowned or burned with flaming oil on the surface
of the sea thousands of German soldiers. Now it is perfectly
possible that the R.A.F. may have surprised and thus treated German
invasion vessels engaged in maneuver or in moving from one
port to another, but it is out of the question that it should have been
a serious attempt at invasion. When that happens there will be
500,000 Germans concerned, not 50,000, and there will be no attempt
at concealment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span></p>

<p>The decisive consideration is that if the Germans had tried an
invasion and the British had beaten it back, the British would have
been certain to advertise their victory as widely as possible. But
British authorities never said anything about a repulsed invasion
attempt. We may be sure that when and if the invasion attempt
comes, there will be no question about what is happening; not even
the most enterprising American newspaperman will be able to get
a scoop on the story.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Would the Germans first invade Ireland in order to be able to
attack the British Isles from all sides?</em></p>

<p>A. Possibly, though not necessarily. The Germans might consider
the disadvantages of taking Ireland greater than the advantages.
The Irish Channel is as wide as the English; the Germans would
be no nearer England than they are now. The possession of submarine
bases in Ireland would be the most important gain for the
Germans. Against this the Germans have to balance the cost of
the operation, since there are strong British units in Northern
Ireland; the time lost; the alarm given; and the effect on the Irish in
America.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why doesn’t Ireland allow the British to take over for the
duration of the war or at any rate let them use the Irish naval bases
they need so badly?</em></p>

<p>A. Because the Irish still consider Oliver Cromwell a far more
unpleasant fellow than Adolf Hitler. They still distrust and to a
degree hate the British. Also they know they would be enslaved if
Hitler won; but they do not expect Hitler to win. They expect
Britain to win, but they will do nothing or practically nothing to
help win. To be fair to the Irish, their attitude is based less on
historical prejudice than on today’s life or death. If De Valera were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
to give the British permission to occupy the Irish ports, the moment
the news became known, the Germans would bombard Dublin and
other Irish cities, and deliberately attempt to kill as many Irish
men, women, and children as possible to punish them for siding
with the English. This is the threat that so far has kept the Irish
from allowing the British in.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>If the Russians hold the German Army long enough, won’t the
time come when the German people will revolt? Why not wait for
that?</em></p>

<p>A. Because it is extremely unlikely ever to happen unless we go to
war. The German people will revolt only when, as Walter Lippmann
expressed it, they feel that it has become more dangerous to
go on with Hitler than to get rid of him. Such a time will come only
when the German people become convinced that they are going
to be defeated and invaded. It will not come merely because the
German Army falls into a prolonged deadlock with the Russians.</p>

<p>There has to be the conviction that foreign troops are going to
enter Germany itself, and that if the German people overthrow
Hitler they will receive milder treatment at the hands of their liberated
victims. The danger of going on with Hitler has to be very
imminent and great to move the German people to revolt, because
the crimes of the Nazis have been so atrocious that the Nazis know
they will be killed if they are overthrown. There must be ten thousand
Nazis who anticipate death if they lose their power either by
revolt or by loss of the war. They will meet any attempt at revolt
with the utmost mercilessness. In the last war there were no Germans
who expected to be killed if Germany lost. The Nazi gang
whose life and death hang on the outcome of the war is larger than
the clique of the German ruling class which had an urgent, though
not life-and-death interest, in seeing the last war to a successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
conclusion. Any hopes that a German revolt would end the war if
the deadlock lasts long enough are based on wishful thinking.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What makes you think Hitler would want to destroy us?</em></p>

<p>A. First, because he could not afford to allow any democracy, any
free state, to exist in his totalitarian world. In his world there would
be only one kind of freedom, the freedom of the German to do
as he likes with all other varieties of men. If Hitler is not interfered
with and has time to accustom his slaves to slavery, his dynasty of
tyrants might last far beyond our lifetime, but not if a single democracy
persists to tempt and challenge his slaves to revolt. Witness
today how for a long time the subjugated peoples of Europe seemed
sunk in abject apathy, but awakened to demonstrate against their
despot the moment Russia’s resistance awakened the hope of
eventual victory. If Hitler wins over the rest of the world, he must
destroy us in order to be safe in his own Empire.</p>

<p>As long as a democracy exists on earth it will hold out before the
eyes of hundreds of millions of Hitler’s subjects the vision of a
place on earth where the body and soul of a man belong to himself
and there are no masters and slaves. Especially dangerous to his rule
would be a democracy which not only offered this vision but was
potentially powerful enough to be a positive threat, as the United
States. For this reason alone Hitler could not allow us to continue
to exist, a free oasis in his vast helot Reich.</p>

<p>Second, Hitler could not afford to give us time to translate our
potential into real strength. He professes two opinions of America.
One is that we are negligible; the other is that as the last war was
decided by America, this one may be. He once told a diplomatic
official of his who still occupies a high post in this country: “The
United States is a degenerate democracy in the backwash of civilization
and too demoralized by pacifism to play any important role in
the war to come.” He is truly contemptuous of our democracy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
as of all democracies, which he judges on the basis of those he has
overthrown or conquered, from the German to the French. He
concludes that we must be weak, since our democratic system dispenses
justice, as far as humanly possible, to the weak as well as to
the strong, and because since the conquest of the continental United
States we have shown little or no interest in building an empire.
To the Nazi heart justice to the weak is a proof of weakness; and
to the Nazi mind only one thing prevents a human being from seizing
the property of a neighbor, weakness. So Hitler on the one hand
thinks us weak, but on the other hand he recognizes that we
could become strong.</p>

<p>As he once told me that he admitted the entry of the United
States into the last war had decided the struggle, so now when
America is preparing to throw its whole weight against him, he
shows signs of wishing to keep us out. By now Britain has taught
him that even a democracy can become tough if it has time. Would
Hitler, after he had crushed the British, willingly give us time to
become morally strong enough to fight him as the British fought
him? Could he afford to let us have the two years or more still
necessary for the physical job of creating the cannon, tanks, airplanes,
and naval vessels and for the training of the officers and
men for an armed force strong enough to face his?</p>

<p>The third simple reason for his wishing to subjugate the United
States is that he wants the loot of America, richest on earth, and
wants us to pay tribute to the Greater German Reich as France and
the other conquered countries are doing now.</p>

<p>Fourth, and not the least, important reason to believe that Hitler
wishes to destroy the United States, is because he has said so. You
remember his speech in the second year of the war when he
said, “We shall destroy Britain and every country which has fed
Britain.” To whom do you suppose he referred if not to the United
States? And do you not think now that it is high time to pay attention
to this no longer funny little man when he announces what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
intends to do? He is unique among conquerors, because he always,
by one means or another, warned his victims of what he intended
to do to them, and in most cases, the Lindberghs of the world have
looked up appeasingly and archly inquired, “Oh no, Mr. Hitler,
you surely don’t mean that, do you?”</p>

<p>As someone expressed it, Hitler has never kept a promise but
never failed to carry out, or at least try to carry out, a threat. His
threat to destroy us has been documented scores of times. Hermann
Rauschning quotes Hitler as declaring privately to friends that he
would conquer the United States first from within, with his Fifth
Column, and Walther Darre, his Minister of Agriculture, has
developed the topic thus: “I have been asked about my opinion of
America, especially the United States, and the danger of this
pseudo-democratic Republic’s possible attempts to hinder us in our
historical development. There is no fear that this demoralized country
will mix in this German war. In the first place, as in France and
other countries, also in the United States, we have many of our
compatriots and even more friends among the citizens of the United
States. Many of the latter hold the most important positions in
political and economic life and will not permit public opinion to
allow something so senseless and insane as war against Germany....
The United States is at present so demoralized and so corrupted
that, like England and France, it need not be taken into consideration
as a military adversary.... The United States will also be
forced by Germany to complete and final capitulation.”</p>

<p>Finally, as we discussed before, Hitler as every conqueror, cannot
stop trying to conquer, and after he had finished with the Old
World, his momentum would force him to attack the New.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Haven’t we plenty to do at home, without getting into a foreign
war? Why don’t we try to make a real democracy in America
before we go out to try to improve the rest of the world?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span></p>

<p>A. This argument that we should pay no attention to the fire in
the house next door because we are busy cleaning the windows of
our house, polishing the floor, and cleaning up the kitchen has the
same amount of logic and common sense as the doctrine that we
ought not to fight on our enemy’s territory but only on our own.
President Hutchins of the University of Chicago has put this argument
of perfectionism in scholarly form. He maintains that we are
going to war to establish throughout the world the Four Freedoms&mdash;of
speech, of worship, from want, and from fear&mdash;but he
says we have no right to crusade for them until we have established
them at home. But we are not going to war to crusade for the
Four Freedoms; as we have pointed out before, we are going to
war to make the world safe for the United States, and at the same
time or thereafter do what we can to establish the Four Freedoms
elsewhere as well as in America. If we do not go to war, we risk
losing even what we have of the Four Freedoms, even the small
quantities of them measured by Dr. Hutchins.</p>

<p>Something of what he says about the failure of the Four Freedoms
in this country to reach perfection is true; not all of it. He
says we have freedom of speech to say only what everybody else
is saying, but Dr. Hutchins will admit we have more of this kind
of freedom than any other country at this moment. He will also
admit that everyone else is not saying the things Dr. Hutchins is
saying and yet he may say them without let or hindrance. He says
we have “freedom of worship if we don’t take our religion too
seriously,” but one must ask oneself what examples of religious
intolerance have given rise to such a statement? Where are the
persecuted religionists and to what country would they flee to
escape from the alleged deficiency of freedom of worship in
America?</p>

<p>Dr. Hutchins says that as for freedom from want and freedom
from fear, so long as one-third of the nation is ill-fed, ill-clothed,
and ill-housed, as Roosevelt says it is, we have no right to try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
establish these freedoms in other countries. Again, we can admit
that the matter is precisely as President Roosevelt has stated it, and
yet assert that the people of the United States have as a whole
better food, clothing, and living conditions than those of any other
country with comparable climatic conditions. He says that as for
democracy, “we know that millions of men and women are disfranchised
in this country because of their race, color, or condition
of economic servitude.” But if by reason of the passive attitude
toward the war advocated by Dr. Hutchins, this country should
fall under Hitler’s power, whether directly, with der Fuehrer in
Washington, or indirectly with der Fuehrer’s Gauleiter, chosen
from the America First Committee as our President, all of America’s
133,000,000 men and women would be wholly disfranchised.</p>

<p>Dr. Hutchins says that we must abandon the Four Freedoms if
we go to war, and that “We cannot suppose, because civil liberties
were restricted in the last war and expanded after it, that we can
rely on their revival after the next one.” Why not? If we cannot
rely on experience, what can we rely on? In every war the United
States has ever fought we have delegated to the executive the
powers necessary to win victory and afterward we have always
taken them back, but without even an argument, much less any
forcible attempt to prevent such action. Dr. Hutchins says, “If we
go to war we cast away our opportunity and cancel our gains. For
a generation, perhaps for hundreds of years, we shall not be able to
struggle back to where we were. In fact, the changes that total war
will bring may mean that we shall never be able to struggle back.
Education will cease. Its place will be taken by vocational and
military training. The effort to establish a democratic community
will stop. We shall think no more of justice, of the moral order and
the supremacy of human rights. We shall have hope no longer.”</p>

<p>Why should these things happen to us if they have never happened
in past wars? Because, says Dr. Hutchins, “this war, if we
enter it, will make the last one look like a stroll in the park.” But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
has the war done any of these things to Britain? On the contrary
it is the unanimous judgment of observers of Britain in wartime that
the British are more just, humane, democratic, and obedient to a
higher moral regime than ever before in their history. The British
are nearer their enemy and more deeply immersed in total war than
we can ever be. Why should we be expected to fare worse than the
British?</p>

<p>Dr. Hutchins expresses concern for “suffering humanity” and
declares we could best serve it by staying out of war, and extending
aid to Britain and China “on the basis most likely to keep us at
peace and least likely to involve us in war.” Is it really helpful to
suffering humanity in Britain, China, France, Russia, Norway,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg, Holland, Belgium, Austria,
yes and in Italy and Germany itself, to practice a policy directed
solely to avoiding conflict with the author of the misery of half
the world?</p>

<p>Aside from that, there is only one choice before America now
and the choice is not between going to war or not going to war.
The choice today is between going to war in time to win it, and
going to war too late to win it. We can best serve “suffering
humanity” by attempting with all the strength of our bodies and
souls to destroy the prime, immediate mundane cause of humanity’s
suffering. Finally, Dr. Hutchins declares that the argument that we
should go to war now when we have Britain to help us, to avoid
having to go to war later, when we should have to face the whole
world alone, rests on the improvable assumptions that Britain must
fall and that the totalitarian powers will wish to, and be able to, and
will attack us. We could debate on these grounds and make a strong
case for even this simplest, most direct form of possible events. But
the argument for war now does not rest alone on this succession of
possible events.</p>

<p>Germany may not be able to conquer Britain, but Britain may
become so weary and so convinced that she cannot defeat Germany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
without us, and so persuaded that we shall never come into the war,
that Britain might make a negotiated peace. Such a peace would be
as disastrous to us as a lost war; to prevent it is as strong a motive for
our going to war now as is the motive of preventing the actual fall
of Britain. Again, unless Britain falls or makes a negotiated peace,
how is any kind of peace to come to the world? By Britain’s defeating
Germany? No, if Russia falls or defects, Britain alone certainly
cannot conquer Germany; no informed person thinks it possible.
Does Dr. Hutchins think Britain could? Does he think it would be
desirable to allow Bolshevik Russia the credit and opportunity of
the land conquest of Germany, which by now is Europe?</p>

<p>Failing to enter the war, we have to face the alternatives; First:
Fall of Britain followed by Axis economic, political, and military
attack on the Western Hemisphere and probable American defeat
by Nazis within as well as without. Second: A negotiated peace
between Britain and Germany; followed by Nazi attack on the
Western Hemisphere as before. Third: Defeat of Germany by
Britain at sea and in the air, and by Russia on land; followed by
Russian Communism throughout Europe. Does Dr. Hutchins believe
this a desirable end, or that the United States would remain
immune from its effects? Fourth: An interminable deadlock in
Europe with the entire world from year to year slipping backward
politically, economically, and morally with no prospect of
anything except more ruined cities, more starving people, more
dead from battle and bombardment, famine and pestilence. Is it
helping suffering humanity to remain aloof and permit any of these
alternatives to come to pass?</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why do you think we ought to go to war with Germany
today?</em></p>

<p>A. Because until Nazi Germany is defeated the world will never
be safe for us to live in; because it will require the total war effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
of the United States and Britain and Russia to defeat Germany;
and because our formal declaration of war would be worth more
in the struggle against Germany than all the material aid we shall
be able to send the Allies for the next year or more.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But wouldn’t it be better to wait and let Hitler declare war on
us?</em></p>

<p>A. It would best serve our interests if Hitler would declare war,
but since he knows this is true, he is not likely to do so under any
provocation. I should think he would hesitate to declare war even
if we were to have a pitched naval battle and sink his ships and
announce it. He knows that even if our Navy is fighting his, there
is still a body of American public opinion which is opposed to the
participation of our Army in an A.E.F. He knows that if he
declared war it would help immensely to unify the American
people. He might go into a fury and declare war, but it would be
unlike him. Behind all his tantrums there is usually calculation.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But isn’t our present state of “undeclared war” just as effective
as being formally at war? Why would our declaration of war be
worth so much immediately?</em></p>

<p>A. Because of its moral effect upon ourselves, our enemies, and
our friends. We can talk all we like about being in a state of
undeclared war, but until we are formally at war we will continue
to behave as though we were at peace. Only by going to war can
we discipline ourselves, our workingmen, and our employers to
defeat the Axis in the battle of production. At this moment when
Britain and Germany are devoting four hours of each working day
to making arms, we are devoting thirty minutes to making arms.
Only by going to war can our citizens’ army get the morale to be
a fighting force.</p>

<p>On the Germans the effect of our declaration of war would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
catastrophic. Every German would say to himself, “Now we can’t
win; we can hold on for a long time, perhaps, but we can’t win.”
On the Italians the effect would be to depress their feeble efforts
still further toward zero.</p>

<p>On the British the effect would be to give them what they lack
and what they most need: the assurance of victory. The British are
convinced that they cannot be defeated, but how are they going to
defeat the Germans without the United States actively in the war?</p>

<p>Upon the Soviet Union the effect would be to strengthen the
resolution of Stalin and the Russian people not to make a compromise
peace nor succumb to any of the temptations Hitler may
offer; and the longer the Red Army fights the Germans the fewer
sacrifices will have to be made by the United States to help win
the war.</p>

<p>To France our declaration of war would bring the will to live
again. Belief in eventual German victory over Britain was the basis
upon which the French surrendered. It was the foundation of
Vichy’s policy. Our declaration of war might not change Pétain
and his men of Vichy, for they are prisoners of their own deeds,
and probably cannot withdraw from their fatal collaboration with
the Germans, but it would move the people of France profoundly.
Pétain does not represent the people of France. I believe far more
in the spirit of my French friend who wrote me: “Soon we shall
all be starving, but send no food. When we are starving will be a
good moment to throw by parachute on every French farm and
on the suburbs of Paris thousands of small machine guns, with the
necessary bullets. Then the German Army will be in France as
Napoleon’s Army was in Spain in 1813.” America’s entry into the
war would be worth to Frenchmen like this more than machine
guns. It would give them the certainty that France will live again.
General de Gaulle’s army would swell by the tens of thousands.</p>

<p>We could reckon on the possibility of being able to occupy
the strategic positions we need in North Africa and on any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
advantages within the power of the French to give us. We could
for the first time anticipate serious revolt by the peoples of all the
occupied territories when the time came; and help for the Allied
Expeditionary Force which some day must invade the continent.
All the enslaved peoples would be equally affected. The Nazi
Terror works perfectly so long as its victims feel that it is hopeless
to revolt. Revolt becomes possible only when the victims feel that
they can afford to risk all, since freedom will eventually be the
reward.</p>

<p>A very important effect of our declaration of war upon Germany
would be the effect upon Japan. The Japanese mental
processes are difficult indeed to understand but I venture to guess
that if they saw us formally aligned with the British for the duration,
they would be likely to take a milder rather than stronger
attitude toward us. Needing principally smaller vessels in the Atlantic,
we could base our main Battle Fleet on Singapore and confidently
await any move Japan might make. Our declaration of
war might well force Japan out of the Axis.</p>

<p>China, like Britain, would be given the most precious possession
in warfare, the assurance of final victory. For even if Japan continued
to fight China, once the Allies’ main task was performed
and Germany defeated, the combined British and American navies
could be counted on to bring Japan back to reason without much
difficulty. On all the other countries, as neutral Portugal, non-belligerent
Spain, encapsuled Sweden and Switzerland, the effect
of our going to war would be revolutionary. Our South American
friends would become even better neighbors. All over the world
the conviction that now Germany will be defeated would become
the decisive element in the policy of every government.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But would we really go to work if we did declare war?
Britain didn’t at first and neither did France. What makes you
think we would?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span></p>

<p>A. You are right. It took Dunkirk to wake Britain up and France
never did awake; she passed without regaining consciousness from
deep sleep to death. Perhaps we too would not awaken even if we
went to war, but we will never awaken until we do go to war.
Most nations in this war have remained curiously apathetic until
their first battle experience; this may be true of us. But the fact of
our being actively belligerent would be bound to improve our
spirit since it would put our moral position right. Ever since the
beginning of the war we Americans have suffered from a divided
personality. Half of our minds clung to the idea that we could
keep at peace if we wished for peace hard enough, and this half
declared: “It is not our war.” This half of our minds made the
Neutrality Act. The other half of our minds realized all along
that we should have been in the war from the beginning, that
Hitler was fighting to conquer the world, that it was for us a matter
of life or death to keep him from succeeding and that every
consideration of self-interest, as of honor, urged us to take our full
part in the world-wide struggle against the new Barbarism. This
half was responsible for the Lease-Lend Bill, a half-measure, condemned
by the very definition: “All aid to Britain <em>short of war</em>!”
Our souls remained divided, and this division has made us an ailing
nation, hypochondriac, complaining of low morale, nervous, and
subject to fits of depression alternating with elation. We are unreasonably
discouraged or cheered as the tide of battle ebbs and
flows, and always we try to interpret whatever happens as a sign
at last that we do not have to do our duty, that after all we can
get out of this task, so onerous, so painful, and so unavoidable.</p>

<p>Completely opposite arguments are employed to prove that we
may escape our obligation. If the British suffer a setback, up goes
the cry: “The British are already beaten; there’s no use trying to
save them now; let’s not throw good money after bad.” If the
British win a victory, there is a rousing cheer: “The British are
winning without us; thank God now we will not have to fight.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
When I came home from the Battle of Britain, it struck me as it
had struck many others who have come to America from the war
zone, that we were far more nervous and agitated than the peoples
at war, even and especially more than those under actual heavy
bombardment. Eve Curie, that admirable French patriot and gallant
fighter for civilization, who was one of our group when we
escaped from France, put it perfectly when she said: “There is
no fear in the countries which are fighting. Extraordinarily
enough, fear has gone somewhere else, to the countries which are
not menaced, to the countries ‘at peace.’”</p>

<p>Is there any reason to suppose that our reactions would be substantially
different from those of the peoples at war? Once we take
a bold stand for the position we know to be just, right, and inevitable,
we shall for the first time since this war began, lose our fear
and become well, strong, hopeful, and proud. The sense of guilt
which has made us nationally unhappy will leave us and we shall
rejoice in a clear conscience.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What effect would our declaring war have upon the morale
of the Army, particularly on that of the selectees, which has been
criticized so much?</em></p>

<p>A. Going to war would unquestionably cure all the troubles of
the Army sooner or later. It is not our soldiers’ fault if today in
peacetime they are restless and discontented at being compelled to
do what must seem to them very like playing at being soldiers.
Would the spirit of a football team be good if the team did nothing
but practice football all day long, month in and month out,
and never played a game, and had no games scheduled? What
would be the spirit of a cast of players if they had rehearsals every
day for months and never staged a performance to an audience,
and had no performances scheduled?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>From your travel throughout the country have you formed
any impression of what the morale of the Army actually is?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, from personal observation, I have reluctantly had to admit
the impression that many of the selectees, at any rate, do not
understand why they are in the Army, nor why there should be
conscription, nor why their period of service was extended. In a
word, they have no desire to fight. Now this could be a most serious
matter, since any nation is doomed if its youth, or any considerable
number of them, are not willing to fight for it, yet this mood
would vanish on our entry into war. The boys are not to blame.
To blame are all the leaders who have confused and deceived them,
the teachers who taught them pacifism and the isolationist politicians
who do the work of Hitler. One of the elements most
confusing in the Army mind is the promise rashly made in the
presidential campaign that we should never engage in a “foreign
war,” a promise no American should have made because nobody
except Hitler had the power to fulfill it.</p>

<p>Now we are paying the penalty democracy always has to pay
for hypocrisy and for deceptions in elections. The penalty is the
state of mind exposed in a questionnaire taken at Camp Callan, San
Diego, among selectees, and published with elation by an isolationist
journal. The soldiers answered: (a) Should the United States
go to war with the Axis immediately? Affirmative, 1 per cent.
(b) Should the United States continue its policy of all-out economic
aid to Britain and expand America’s military and naval
forces in order to fight the Axis powers overseas if the Axis powers
are not defeated by Britain? Affirmative, 25 per cent. (c) Should
the United States guard the Western Hemisphere but send no
military aid outside this area? Affirmative, 39 per cent. (d) Should
the United States be strictly neutral and prepare to defend only
our own territory and possessions? Affirmative, 37 per cent. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
answers would have distressed Count Leo Tolstoy if Tolstoy were
an American living today.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, who was as great a student of war as he was a novelist,
has a formula whereby he could interpret this poll and give us a
rough estimate of the military effectiveness of an army made up
of soldiers with the attitude revealed by this questionnaire. In <cite>War
and Peace</cite>, his epic novel on Napoleon’s invasion of Russia, he
says: “<em>In warfare</em> the force of armies is the product of the mass
multiplied by something else, an unknown X. X is the spirit of the
army, the greater or less <em>desire to fight</em> and to face dangers on the
part of all the men composing the army.” Note that Tolstoy says
“<em>desire</em> to fight” not just “<em>willingness</em> to fight.” The emphasis is on
the positive desire not passive willingness. This is another way to
express the paramount importance of morale. What is morale? It is
knowing what you have to fight about and having the desire to
fight for it. But only one per cent of the selectees questioned indicated
they knew what they had to fight about and desired to
fight; one-third thought we ought to be “strictly neutral,” and
three-fourths were against fighting anywhere outside of our hemisphere.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>The selectees evidently had been influenced by the arguments
for passive hemisphere defense, but what do you think of the argument
that we should never fight on foreign soil, but if we have to
fight, let it be in America?</em></p>

<p>A. It reminds me of the Chinese and the Japanese soldiers at the
beginning of their war. I saw the fall of Shanghai, and I couldn’t
help but remark that while the Chinese soldier said, “I will die for
China,” the Japanese soldier said, “I will kill for Japan,” and so for
a long time the two got along perfectly together. For every American
who may declare, “I don’t want to fight on foreign soil; if I
have to fight I want to fight only at home,” there is a German who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
declares, “I don’t want to fight at home; I fight only on foreign
soil,” as the Germans have consistently done to the best of their
ability for the last hundred years. May we never accommodate the
Germans in this respect. Surely of all the isolationist arguments this
is the least intelligent, to prefer that the fearful destruction of war
be wrought on our own homes. It is an argument you will never
hear in our Southern states.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What should we do with conscientious objectors?</em></p>

<p>A. Reason with them. Many honest conscientious objectors can be
converted by the right kind of reasoning, and the more honest they
are the easier it is to straighten out their misunderstandings. If this
fails then they ought to be given work to do at some enterprise of
national interest, and be compelled to do it, as the government is
now doing in its camps for conscientious objectors. If they refuse
to register, they go to jail, as no government could afford to tolerate
deliberate defiance of its laws. We as a democracy must observe
the rights even of a minority which would bring ruin upon
the country if its policies were to rule. This is something we can
be proud of, something that marks us more than any other one
thing as different from the tyrannous Nazi state where conscientious
objectors and every variety of pacifist or obstructionist is put
to death. We can afford to treat our objectors as we would defectives.
Hitler has to kill his. He held from the beginning that
pacifists were the greatest danger to the state, and from the moment
he came to power he has sought out and executed every German
pacifist who has revealed himself. Hitler thus proves he feels
that pacifist doctrine would be dangerous to his regime, as it would.</p>

<p>The German nation is being led by Hitler in <em>aggressive</em> war. Opposition
to aggressive war is a form of pacifism which makes sound
sense. The war we and the British are called upon to fight, a war
we did not want but are compelled to carry on in order to save our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
national lives, is a war that even a pacifist ought to support. In this
war the man who refuses to fight for his country is like a person in
a lifeboat who refuses to pull an oar. In England a conscientious
objector was asked at his examination whether he would do non-combatant
war work. He answered, “No.” The Judge asked
“Would you not help build an air-raid shelter?” The man answered,
“No.” The Judge then asked, “But if there were an air raid on
would you go into a shelter someone else had built?” The man
answered, “Yes.” I wonder how many of the 1,800 young Americans
who have been classified as conscientious objectors would contend
that this is honest, and yet it is fundamentally the attitude of
all conscientious objectors. The nation shelters the lives, liberty,
and property of all its citizens. Everyone living in the nation is enjoying
this protection. Everyone has a primary obligation to help
maintain it. In England today, however, the government permits
more than 40,000 registered conscientious objectors to enjoy the
protection of the air-raid shelters, and of the Royal Air Force,
Army, and Navy, without contributing to it. Is this not a tribute
to the invincible liberalism of Anglo-Saxon democracy?</p>

<p>The conscientious objector had a better case in almost all other
wars than he has in this one. The modern pre-Hitler war had a
superficial course something like this: The victor occupied the
vanquished country, made a peace treaty, collected an indemnity,
then withdrew to his own country with what loot he could carry.
A part of the vanquished country might be annexed to the victor.
The defeated nation smarted under the humiliation but in time the
population resumed its ordinary life, and within a few years a
stranger could hardly find signs of any change as a result of the loss
of the war. A pacifist might argue that under these circumstances it
would pay not to resist since the loss by fighting would be greater
than the loss by nonresistance, considerable though that might be.
This is not that kind of war. Hitler does not intend to restore the
sovereignty of the nations he conquers. All Hitler’s wars are more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
or less Carthaginian. For as long as Hitler remains the master, his
vanquished will be slave states, with their citizens chained to the
Nazi machine, their women degraded, their religion persecuted,
their schools closed, their books burned, and all this will continue
until Hitler is overcome by force. It is not a choice between greater
or lesser evils. It is a choice between life and death, for those who
physically survive under the Hitler tyranny are condemned to a
living death, as the Poles can testify.</p>

<p>Most of the great pacifist leaders have been converted by their
observation of Hitler. Albert Einstein was thought of as the
world’s greatest pacifist, but he abandoned the doctrine of non-violence
after only a few months spent under the Hitler regime
before he escaped to America. On his way here Einstein passed
through Belgium and in an interview published in a Brussels newspaper
declared: “If I were a young Belgian today, I would not
refuse military service.” From a man who all his life had been a militant
pacifist, taking part in world campaigns against war, this statement
ought to persuade any young man. Britain’s leading pacifist,
Bertrand Russell, has likewise been persuaded to give up his “isolationism”
and to advocate that we give up ours, because the airplane,
annihilating distances, has made it impossible for any nation
“to secure peace for itself by isolation.” But Hitler is more persuasive,
it seems to me.</p>

<p>Hitler writes that the Germans “will give what many blinded
pacifists hope to get by moaning and crying,” namely, “a peace,
supported not by the palm branches of tearful pacifist professional
female mourners, but founded by the victorious sword of a people
of overlords which puts the world into the service of a higher culture.”
And again he wrote: “Indeed the pacifist-humane idea is
perhaps quite good whenever the man of the highest standard has
previously conquered and subjected the world to a degree that
makes him the only master of this globe.” That is surely clear
enough to convince the most conscientious objector that if everyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
refused to fight Hitler he would conquer the world, and as
President Conant of Harvard says, men would have no more freedom
than horses have now. It is not pleasant to have to agree with
Hitler, but one must admit he defined the conscientious objector
correctly when he declared the healthy, unspoiled boy would willingly
give his life for his country and thus “obeys the deeper necessity
of the preservation of the species, if necessary at the expense
of the individual,” while the pacifist egotistically puts his interest
ahead of the nation. The charge of cowardice is easy to make, and
I for one shall not make it. I prefer to think of most conscientious
objectors as men who have not thought the problem through. After
all, one of them was named Sergeant York.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why don’t we have a department in our Army to tell the
soldiers why they are in uniform?</em></p>

<p>A. We have a morale section in the Army but it cannot operate
effectively until we are at war. It is forbidden to discuss “politics”
with the soldiers and it would be “politics” now to explain that they
are in uniform to fight the Germans. Yet nothing could be more
valuable for our war effort than to have qualified men visit each
army camp, and after a series of public lectures on America and
the war, conduct a question-and-answer period, followed by individual
conferences with soldiers interested enough to ask for them.
Officers would probably benefit as much from such instruction as
the men.</p>

<p>One of the most useful departments of the German Army is its
morale section which teaches a recruit above all things to be proud
to be a soldier, and that it is the highest honor for him to be permitted
to fight for his country. It is my impression that we would
have to be even more elementary than that. Some American youths
need to have it explained that from time immemorial the young
men of a family, a tribe, or a nation have been by nature required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
to be its physical defenders; that the old men, women, and children
have other duties to perform, but the young men are the only ones
strong enough to go out and fight. Statements as simple as that are
necessary after our last twenty years of pacifism and materialism.
Too many times young men have asked me why they should fight
for a society they do not approve, a society which does not provide
them with good jobs and a comfortable life. The answer is that if
they do not understand now, Hitler will provide a sufficient explanation
later, as the pacifist students of the University of Paris
found out when the Germans occupied their city and shot a score
of them as a lesson.</p>

<p>Hitler will make it plain that this is no class war. Hitler will
make it clear that it is a simple tribal war of a brute soldier-state
bent upon the subjugation of all other states and peoples, good, bad,
or indifferent, and of all classes. The English have learned this is
no class war and every kind of Englishman, rich and poor alike,
are united now in one great fighting tribe. Our youth could learn
from the example of the youth of conquered Europe that if they
do not successfully defend their country, imperfect though it may
be, they will be conquered and cast into slavery.</p>

<p>It would be useful to point out that this generation of American
youth is alive and enjoying the privileges of this country because
other young men years ago and centuries ago fought and defeated
the enemies of America. It would clear up many a young soldier’s
difficulties if he were given an explanation in the simplest language
of the origins and issues of the war. Many of them hardly know
the bare facts of who is fighting whom. The American soldier has
a right to be given the overwhelming evidence that Germany intends
to destroy the American form of life, and subjugate us if she
can; and that just now while Britain and Russia are absorbing so
much German energy is the best time for us to defend ourselves by
the only method of defense that has ever succeeded, by attack; by
striking with all the power we possess at the enemy while he is still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
far from our shores. The American soldier should understand that
much as we may wish for it, there is little hope that Britain and
Russia alone could defeat the mighty German war machine, built
as it was during the nine years while we slept. He should understand
that this means we must fight in Europe, help destroy the
German Air Force, invade the continent, and finally occupy Germany;
that this will require every available resource of muscle and
money and brain and blood and several more years of war, but that
the reward for this immense payment is the immense reward of
freedom. The American soldier has a right to have outlined to him
the kind of world Hitler would make if he won; and the kind of
world we hope to make if we win. This is the ABC of war, and it
is what our soldiers desperately need, but it is unlikely that they
will get it until we go to war.</p>

<p>It takes a great deal of re-education to counter the last two decades
of intellectual rule by our “Irresponsibles,”&mdash;professors, writers,
artists, and scholars who debunked our past history and every
ideal, taught that man’s economic life is all that matters, that soldiers
are suckers, that we fought the last war for J. P. Morgan, and so on
until bewildered American boys exclaimed: “My country owes me
a living; I owe it nothing.” Yet that is not youth’s natural way. Hitler
won the German youth not by offering them fun or comfort or
material reward; he appealed to them to sacrifice themselves for
their Fatherland, and they responded joyously, “like demons,” as
Colonel Schieffer said. Nobody can persuade me that our American
youth would not respond even more joyously to an honest appeal,
but the appeal has to be clear, simple, ringing as the notes of a bugle
in the morning. Let the cynics and the selfish jibe, but American
youth will eventually respond to the call of President Roosevelt
for the Four Freedoms, not just for themselves, but for all the
world.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But weren’t we suckers in the last war?</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span></p>

<p>A. No, we were not suckers in the last war. By fighting and beating
Germany in the last war, side by side with our Allies, we won
twenty-three years of national independence.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But didn’t we fight the last war to “make the world safe for
democracy” and to “end all war”? We certainly failed to do either.
Weren’t we suckers to have tried and failed?</em></p>

<p>A. Don’t you think it was worth while for us to gain the right to
live in peace and freedom from 1918 to 1939 even if we failed to
achieve our whole program? We did not fight the last war just “to
make the world safe for democracy” or to “end all war.” We
fought the last war primarily to make the world safe for the
United States, and we succeeded in that for a good many years. The
world has not been safe for democracy everywhere for a score of
years, but only now do we find it necessary to fight again because
only now has it become plain that the world is again no longer safe
for the United States. In the last war we fought first to preserve
America, second to make the world safe for democracy, and to end
war. In this war we are fighting first to preserve America, second
to establish the Four Freedoms everywhere we can, but we modestly
refrain this time from announcing that we expect to end war.
Instead we have much more practically declared that when we
win we will disarm the nations that made this war.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But what difference would it have made to us if we had not entered
the last war at all?</em></p>

<p>A. It would have meant that the Germans probably would have
won the war. The Commander in Chief of the Allies, Foch, and
the actual Commander in Chief of the Germans, Ludendorff, both
admitted that the American entry into the war was decisive. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
not that America “won the war,” but that without us the Allies
could not have won.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Suppose the Germans had won the last war; what difference
would that have made to us?</em></p>

<p>A. If the Germans had won, we should certainly have had to fight
them thereafter and fight them alone. We may have had a few years
respite, long enough for the German Navy to become strong
enough to challenge ours. The general situation today is parallel
with the one in 1914-1918, except that Hitler’s Germany is much
more powerful and evil than Hohenzollern Germany. Nevertheless
Kaiser Wilhelm had the same ambition Hitler has. He believed also
that the Germans were a master race, with a divine mission to rule
the world. The Germans came late to nationhood, too late to receive
“their share” of the colonies. This helped give them a bitter
sense of resentment against a world which refused to recognize
their superiority. This German belief that they are superior to
everyone on earth is unfortunately strengthened by the fact that
in this industrial age they are among the most talented of all peoples,
and in the natural sciences superior to most others. They have
proved themselves incorrigible except by force.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Some people argue though, that Hitler actually wants the
United States to come into the war, so that we would keep our war
supplies, instead of sending them to England and to Russia. Is this
true?</em></p>

<p>A. How could it ever have been true, since Hitler always, at any
moment, could have brought us into the war if and when he
wished. He has only to order one or more of his transatlantic submarines
to come over and sink a few American ships in our territorial
waters and even a pacifist Congress would vote war. A score
of other easy devices have always been at his hand if he wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
war with us, but wished us to declare it. But why should he wish to
bring against him the greatest single potential power, even if he
thought that our entering formal war would cause us to withhold
supplies from Britain and Russia? And what is there anyway to
make anybody think that if we ever became sensible enough to go
to war we would at the same time become so unintelligent as to
cripple the war effort against our enemy? What point would there
be in withholding supplies from Britain and Russia just because we
had gone to war with Germany? Would we in the United States be
in any more danger after having gone to war than before? No, we
would actually be safer, since the safety afforded us by the British
Fleet’s control of the Atlantic would now be augmented by removal
of all limitation on the use of the extra power of our own
Atlantic vessels. Suppose, however, that we thought it desirable for
a time to curtail some shipments to the Allies while we filled in certain
gaps in our own armament. Could this temporary diversion of
strength outweigh the danger to Hitler of America’s strength in
the long run?</p>

<p>I venture to say that this argument against our going to war has
done as much harm as almost any other, and upon examination it
seems it must have been of German origin, despite the fact that
many a good American and even some good Englishmen have
thoughtlessly repeated it. The person most competent to judge
whether Hitler wants us in the war is Hitler. As I recently recollected
when looking over some old clippings, Hitler in an interview
in 1932 expressed it to me this way: “I was a soldier in the
war and it was my conviction that without American participation
on the side of the Allies, we would surely have won the war.”
This is what he thought of America in the last war. You may be
sure he thinks exactly the same of America in this war.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But the Germans have frequently expressed not merely indifference
but contempt of us, and have spoken as though they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
not care whether we entered or not. Isn’t it then an exaggeration
to say that our declaration of war would have such a tremendous
effect on their morale?</em></p>

<p>A. No, because the Germans have expressed indifference to
whether we enter the war only because they were absolutely convinced
that we would not do so; when we do enter the war it will
be an even greater shock than if they had anticipated it all the
time. Our official behavior for a long time, and the utterances of
our isolationists all the time, led the Nazis to believe we were really
for peace at any price; that nothing, neither injury nor insult,
could move us to war. When the first Neutrality Act was passed
in August, 1935, the Germans, as I have recently been reminded
by a friend who was in Berlin at the moment, chortled with glee,
and editorials boasted that now Europe could settle its troubles
secure from the meddlesome Yankee. No one can estimate how
much influence this surrender of American rights had upon Hitler
during that critical time when he was weighing his strength
against all his possible enemies. The Germans are convinced we
are a money-loving people and when the Johnson Act was passed,
forbidding credit to any nation in default on payment of its debt
to us, they exclaimed: “Now the Americans will never go to war
again because they can’t make money out of it.”</p>

<p>The Johnson Act almost persuaded some Germans that we had
changed sides, and Nazis revived their chatter about the essentially
Germanic character of America. We Americans may be wishful
thinkers, but the Germans, fortunately, are even more addicted to
the vice than we. Goebbels’ control of the press promotes it. Every
isolationist speech made is printed at length in the German newspapers
and the voice of Lindbergh is taken as the voice of America.
The re-election of Roosevelt was the first warning the German
people had that America might act to defend herself. Now sensible
Germans are beginning to be frightened. I know how the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
German people regard America. They call it the “land of unlimited
possibilities.” It has always been the dreamland of the Germans,
and if our immigration laws had permitted it, we should
have had tens of millions of Germans coming to this country after
the war. The tremendous size and economic power of America
fascinate all classes of Germans; they have never forgotten the
shock they received when, after the armistice in 1918, they learned
for the first time what their government had concealed from them,
that there were over two million American soldiers in France.
Hitler tried to stamp out German admiration or regard for any
foreign country, and doubtless German successes in this war have
influenced the German attitude to a degree, but the fundamental
element in German thought about America is their ineffaceable
memory of the last war: “America joined our enemies; we lost.
If America goes to war against us again, we cannot win.” It would
be decisive.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But where would we fight Germany? What is the good of
America’s entering the war if there is no battleground?</em></p>

<p>A. We would fight her first where we are fighting her now, in the
Atlantic and on all the seas. The difference between our naval
action if we were at war and as it is under the President’s orders to
hunt down pirates, would be considerable. At war we would fully
collaborate with the British Navy in the critical waters along the
coast of Europe and in the zone of greatest danger just west of
England where the Germans sink about nine-tenths of their victims.
The reason the Germans have been so much more effective
in counter-blockading England in this war than they were in the
last war is of course the airplane, which not only bombs and sinks
as many ships as the submarine, but also provides the submarine
with eyes in the air.</p>

<p>Our air force, and especially our naval air force, greatly augmented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
after our entry into the war, would play a large role in
cleansing the air of these German raiders. Eventually our air force
operating with the R.A.F. and based wherever the R.A.F. is based
would, we hope, become strong enough to dominate the air over
the continent. That is the goal toward which all efforts lead; it
would be the turning point of the war. Experts estimate that it will
probably take two years to reach quantitative superiority over the
Germans, and then only if we are not only formally at war but
actually making war with all our might.</p>

<p>The site of the battlefields after the winning of the Battle of
the Atlantic and the Battle of Britain, depends upon too many unknown
factors to make more than a guess now. Possible landing
places for an expeditionary force extend from Norway to the
Spanish frontier, North Africa, the Near East, and the Balkans.
There are also the immense possibilities opened by the Battle of
Russia. In considering the possibilities of success for an expeditionary
force to invade German Europe we ought not to be discouraged
by the failure of the Allies in Norway, Greece, and
Crete, because the German Army’s morale and strength will be
quite different whenever the conditions for invasion of the continent
exist. It was the German Air Force which, more than any
other factor, defeated the Allies in these three early affrays.</p>

<p>When the Luftwaffe has lost control of the daylight air and
the German Army is still further weakened by its colossal losses in
Russia, and the German people are weighed down by the fear of
ultimate defeat and apprehension of vengeance, and the population
of conquered Europe, elated at the prospect of liberation, is revolting,
the chances of success for an Allied Expeditionary Force
would be strong. Military experts are agreed that it would court
disaster to try it before these conditions are fulfilled. Ever since
the Battle of Russia began, impatient groups in England have
clamored for an immediate attempt at invasion of the continent,
and one can imagine how painful it must be for the perpetually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
aggressive Churchill to be forced to counsel prudence. He knows
that if such an attempt were made and failed it could be fatal.
On the other hand, if the Allied High Command waits for the
favorable circumstances which are to be expected if we enter the
war, we could justly hope not only to be able to invade the continent
successfully but at low cost.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Would United States troops be required for such an expeditionary
force? Are we going to have another A.E.F.?</em></p>

<p>A. I should think so, although one must admit the bare possibility
that the Battle of Russia could make our participation with land
troops less necessary militarily, although the political reasons for
our entry would be strongest if the Red Army were winning. If
the Russians were to whittle down the German land army sufficiently,
the British might become strong enough eventually to deliver
the knockout blow alone, but I doubt it. There are just twice
as many Germans as there are English, and numbers still count,
as we observe in Russia. A cool appraisal of the future indicates
that the chances are against our being able to win the war without
sending an A.E.F. If we go to war, it cannot be with any reservations.
We cannot make war on a limited liability basis. There are
strong reasons also for us to want to be represented in the armies
of liberation. By the time matters have reached the stage for contemplation
of an invasion of Europe, the temper of America may
have so changed that there may be a great popular demand for an
A.E.F.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What are the strong reasons for our wanting to be represented
with the armies of liberation?</em></p>

<p>A. In order to be fully represented at the peace. There is no substitute
for an army at a Peace Conference, and we may be sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
that, no matter what arrangements may be made between Mr.
Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt, if we are not in the war we will not
be in the peace. There were many jokes about the famous eight-point
meeting to the effect that we were trying to get in the peace
before we got in the war. I do not agree that that was the purpose
of Mr. Roosevelt in meeting Mr. Churchill, but if it were, it is
unlikely to succeed. We will have the influence we wish to have
at the peace conference only if we have done our full share in
making peace possible by beating Hitler. We ought not to deceive
ourselves. We are unpopular enough as it is now. If we stay out of
the war, and by a miracle not now foreseeable, Hitler were after
all to be defeated, what do you think the victors would think of
us? Do you think they would invite us to come in and tell them
how to rearrange the world?</p>

<p>Yet if we do not look forward to establishing a peace which will
postpone for a long time, if not forever, a repetition of this war,
many Americans would feel too discouraged to act. We would be
foolish not to fight the Germans now even if we were mathematically
certain that we were going to have to go on fighting them
once every twenty years for the rest of time. Nevertheless we
do not want to face such a prospect; we want to rule out war for
as long a time as possible, and we can do it only by repairing at
this Peace Conference the errors made after the last one.</p>

<p>These errors were not what they have been represented to be,
faults in the Versailles treaty. The mistake we made was that we
dodged our responsibility for the peace after we had helped finish
the war. First we invested our blood and treasure, and then after
the victory, when we were about to gather the dividends of international
security and prosperity in the League of Nations, suddenly,
because everything in the peace did not completely please
us, and because a few politicians hated the President, we withdrew
and declined to collect our profits. This ruined the peace, made
the League impossible, and another war certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How much American blood and treasure did we spend in the
last war?</em></p>

<p>A. Very little blood compared with our Allies. Out of our total
mobilized force of 4,355,000 we lost 126,000 dead of all causes, or
two and one-half per cent. Out of the total of 17,314,000 British
and French soldiers, 2,266,171 lost their lives, or 13 per cent. If we
had been compelled from 1914 on to fight as totally as our Allies,
with our population more than double the combined French and
British populations, we would have lost more than 2,000,000 dead
during the time we were leaving the fighting to our Allies, from
1914 to 1917. We sent money instead; altogether our war loans
totaled thirteen billion dollars. It is fair to say that this investment
of money took the place of investment of lives. It cost us less than
$7,000 apiece to save 2,000,000 American men’s lives. Any insurance
company would call that a bargain, considering the American
man merely from the point of view of what he is economically
worth to his nation. Nevertheless we asked for the thirteen billion
back. At the same time we put up our tariffs so high that the nations
concerned could not pay, but aside altogether from the economic
aspect of our war debts, consider what could have happened
had we been wiser.</p>

<p>Suppose, at an appropriate period after passions had subsided, we
had proposed to Britain and France that we cancel the war debts if
they would cancel the reparations owed by Germany. There was
a time when such a proposal might have succeeded. What would
have been the probable, or at any rate possible, outcome? No war
debts, no reparations, no inflation in Germany, no Hitler, no war
now. Even if there were only a chance of such miraculous results,
it would have been well worth trying, since the actual results of
our unenlightened egotism were that we were never paid the
money anyway, and the chain of reparations&mdash;inflation&mdash;Hitler&mdash;brought
us to this war upon which we are planning already to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
spend as a mere first installment four times as much as the whole
sum we lent the Allies and lost in the last war. It is significant that
the very men who urged that we press without respite for full payment
of our World War debts, and thus helped make this war inevitable,
are the very men who today continue to try to make
America shirk her responsibilities.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Do you think a new League of Nations could be successful,
since the old one failed so miserably?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, if we do our duty and make it possible for the League to
work. We blew the old League up when we refused to join it, and
rejected the Versailles treaty and declined to join France and England
in a treaty of mutual guarantee. With us not participating, the
League was doomed from the start. Our withdrawal from Europe
upset the balance of power so heavily in Germany’s favor that
France, and eventually Britain, had to make out of the League a
coalition against Germany. This they did. Even so it failed to keep
the peace because Germany was stronger than all the League members
together. Had we stayed in the League we might have made
collective security really work.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How could America have made the League work?</em></p>

<p>A. There is a popular belief that Germany might have remained a
good neighbor and respectable member of society if the Weimar
Republic had been better treated by France and her Allies. I am not
sure of that, but if it is true, let us ask why France treated Germany
harshly throughout the life of the Weimar Republic. The answer
is that France was afraid of Germany, and as we see today, with
good reason. The French fear was based on the facts that there
were twice as many Germans as French, and that these Germans
had just about beaten France and all her Allies, including Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
Britain, until the United States stepped in. Obviously the French
reasoned the United States’ protection was indispensable to French
security. Without the United States in the League the French had
to look for security elsewhere. They sought it in encirclement of
Germany and conversion of the League into an anti-German
alliance.</p>

<p>If you object that the League is impracticable, let us ask what
there is to put in its place. I use the term League to indicate any
association of nations for collective security. Isolationism was our
policy from 1919 to 1941. Its failure has been cosmic. The group
of Senators and Congressmen who killed the League by preventing
us from joining it were as responsible as Hitler for the war today.
Twenty-two years later the political successors of Wilson’s “willful
men” made it appear to Hitler and Mussolini and the war party
in Japan that we would never stir and that aggressors could leave
the United States completely out of their reckoning. Many of these
men in the Senate and the House are today, as the isolationists were
in 1919, actuated chiefly by an ignoble hatred for their political
opponent, the President.</p>

<p>Carlton J. Hayes, professor of history at Columbia, says: “We
were the final determining factor in winning the last World War,
but more than any nation, even more than Nazi Germany, we have
been responsible for losing the peace and bringing on the present
world war. We insisted on our rights and spurned our duties. Victim
ourselves of a bad kind of narrow nationalism, we repudiated
the League of Nations which our President had fashioned and we
thus set the pace for all of its later floutings by other powers.
Moreover we selfishly and shortsightedly refused to forgive the
inter-Allied debts and thereby prevented any timely forgiving of
the fateful German reparations. The result is that Germany now has
Hitler, while we are accumulating a debt for national defense which
makes the inter-Allied debts and the reparations of the last war
seem trivial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span></p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>If we did defeat Germany, could we then return to the kind of
peaceful lives we led before this war began?</em></p>

<p>A. No, but the defeat of Germany is the indispensable condition
for us to have any kind of tolerable life again. After this war, which
is likely to last many years still, we are going to be a different nation.
We are going to be more united than ever before. We are
going to have shared common dangers, hopes, and fears, and for the
first time since the Civil War we are going to rise above our materialism
and act for an ideal.</p>

<p>We have never had to face real trouble together since the thirty
million new members of our family arrived between 1870 and
1930. We did not really suffer in the first World War; we never
had a chance to test the strength of our arms or the temper of our
spirit. How many times have we heard the question asked, whether
we were “really” a nation? Now we shall have the chance to prove
that we are. Now America will come of age.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">7. FIFTH COLUMNISTS</h2>
</div>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What makes Lindbergh the way he is?</em></p>

<p>A. I am glad you asked this question because Lindbergh is our
greatest native individual threat to American safety and so deserves
careful scrutiny by his fellow citizens who some day may be
compelled to decide what to do with him. There is nothing to be
gained by abusing him, nor is there any merit in arguing that his
sincerity ought to protect him against the charge that he assists
America’s Fifth Column.</p>

<p>Hitler’s most effective Fifth Columnists in every country have
for the most part been sincere men, but their sincerity has not
relieved them of the verdict of the fellow citizens they betrayed,
nor of the verdict of history. The President of the United States
has delivered that verdict upon Lindbergh already. In the most
polite and restrained language he classified Colonel Lindbergh as
a “Copperhead,” which was a Civil War name for a man in the
North who sympathized with the Southern cause. Translated into
today’s situation it would mean an American citizen who sympathizes
with the enemy of America, Germany.</p>

<p>You recollect the President was asked why Lindbergh, who was
given a reserve commission in the Army Air Corps after his flight
to Paris, had not been called into active service. The President
replied that during the Civil War both sides let certain people
go; that is, did not call them into service.</p>

<p>He said the people who were thus ignored were the Vallandighams,
and explained that the Vallandighams were the people
who from 1863 on, urged immediate peace, arguing that the North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
could not win the war between the states. The President’s reference
to Vallandigham sent many to their reference books where
they found that Clement Laird Vallandigham, an Ohio Congressman
“in 1863, made violent speeches against the administration
and was arrested by the military authorities, tried by military
commission and sentenced to imprisonment. President Lincoln
commuted his sentence to banishment and Vallandigham was sent
into the Confederate lines, whence he made his way to Canada.”</p>

<p>President Roosevelt was choosing his word carefully, in order
to get the precise shade of meaning attributed to it. The President
apparently tried to find in American history as accurate a parallel
to the Lindbergh case as possible. His choice was significant. It
would be interesting to know if the President had in mind that
when this country is formally at war with Germany we shall incarcerate
or deport members of the community who for whatever reason
and with whatever motives hinder the prosecution of the war.
The expulsion of Vallandigham to the enemy’s territory raises the
question of the physical possibility as well as the political expediency
of deporting our Fifth Columnists to German-controlled territory
after we are formally at war. Few of us will dispute the
desirability of just such a radical solution.</p>

<p>Lindbergh replied to the President by resigning his commission
in a letter saying, “I had hoped that I might exercise my right as
an American citizen to place my viewpoint before the people of
my country in time of peace without giving up the privilege of
serving my country as an Air Corps officer in the event of war.”
Thereafter many professional critics of the President accused him
of having attempted to gag Lindbergh. But the very opposite is
the case since if the President had wanted to shut Lindbergh’s
mouth, all he had to do was to call him to active service where
the rule is universal that serving officers may not make public
political statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span></p>

<p>It should be remembered that Lindbergh, although a reserve
officer, had violently attacked his Commander in Chief’s actions
in the field of foreign policy, which naturally involves military
affairs, and this could certainly be regarded as a breach of discipline
in the spirit if not in the letter of the officers’ code. If President
Roosevelt had wished not only to muzzle, but to discipline Lindbergh,
nothing would have been easier than for the President to
have ordered the Colonel to duty in some obscure, remote, or
unpleasant post, a frequent method of discipline in the armed
services of all countries. But the President did nothing of the sort.
On the contrary, by accepting Lindbergh’s resignation he released
the flyer from any hindrance to the free speech which he has since
been exercising so vigorously.</p>

<p>But Lindbergh is far more dangerous to American security than
was Vallandigham a danger to the Union in our Civil War. Lindbergh
is already the avowed candidate of our enormous crop of
Copperheads for the Presidency of the United States. He has the
applause of the enemies of democracy and of the United States
throughout the world. A Belgian businessman, a devout “collaborationist”
with the Nazis, told a friend of mine recently, “Lindbergh
will be the next President of the United States. He could get along
splendidly with Hitler. We are all for him.” By “We” this Belgian
meant the entire herd of Hitler followers, from his own disciplined
legions to the servile rabble of Vichy France and the Copperheads
of the United States. Whether Lindbergh welcomes it
or not, he has the enthusiastic applause of the Nazi Bund, the
Fascist societies, and of all the most violently antidemocratic
groups in this country, from the followers of Father Coughlin to
the most eccentric Kluxers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span></p>

<p class="qu">Q. <em>But are we being fair to Lindbergh in calling him a Copperhead
and a Fifth Columnist?
Didn’t you say yourself that there is nothing to be gained by abusing
him?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, I maintain there is nothing to be gained by abusing him,
but there is much to be gained by identifying him. Nobody has
done it any better than the country’s wittiest enemy of our enemies,
Alexander Woollcott, in his “Voice from a Cracker Barrel” broadcast,
when he said: “By the pledges of both candidates in the last
election, by the testimony of every poll yet taken by Dr. Gallup,
by the action of our representatives in Congress and of the President
himself, we pledged full aid to England. Ex-Colonel Lindbergh
now argues that this assistance be withdrawn.</p>

<p>“He wants us to break our promise in the matter, to run out on
the British, and, so curious is his mentality, he thinks to encourage
us in such base desertion by assuring us that England is going to
be defeated. On this point he may be right. I would not know
about that. Neither would he. If the words of our retired eagle
ever reach as far as England, Mr. Churchill must derive some comfort
from his knowledge that all fighters in a tight place have
heard such talk since the world began. Among Washington’s discomforts
during the long winter at Valley Forge was the repeated
prediction from the Lindberghs of his day that he didn’t have a
chance. Yes, Lindbergh keeps announcing the doom of England,
and always his statement is received with cheers and bursts of
applause. This gives you a rough idea of what kind of people bulk
large in his mass meetings.</p>

<p>“For here is a fact which Lindbergh and his colleagues of the
America First Committee must face. Whether they admit it or
not, whether they like it or not, whether, indeed, that is any part
of their purpose, they are working for Hitler. Have you any
doubt&mdash;any doubt at all&mdash;that Hitler would have been glad to pay
Lindbergh an immense amount, millions, for the work he has done
in the past year?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed, if Lindbergh shares the opinion of Hitler held by the
rest of us&mdash;on this point, to be sure, he has thus far been ominously
silent&mdash;his heart must skip a beat when, in the still watches of the
night, he realizes that if he had returned to this country as Hitler’s
paid and trusted agent, his public activity would have been in
every particular just what it has been to date.</p>

<p>“Now don’t get me wrong about this. I doubt that Lindbergh
has taken or would take German money. It so happens that we do
not know, and, thanks to the reticence of General Wood, have
been unable to find out just who has put up all the money for the
costly goings-on of the America First Committee. But I should be
greatly surprised to learn that any considerable part of that money
came directly or indirectly from Hitler. That does not alter the
fact that they are all working for him. For they, like the rest of
us, are trapped in a tragic irony. In this world today there is no
such thing as neutrality. You are either for Hitler or against him.
You either fight him or you help him.”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why can’t we put Lindbergh away somewhere now, so he
can’t do any more harm?</em></p>

<p>A. It is certainly an index to the feelings of the vast majority of
the American people that despite the fact that Lindbergh and
Senator Wheeler can draw large crowds of their Copperhead
followers, I have received hundreds of questions like the one you
ask, and there seems to be little sectional, geographical difference
in American feelings on the subject.</p>

<p>Just as many have made the inquiry in California as in Texas
or Pennsylvania. The answer is that we cannot, and if we reflect
upon it, we do not want to put any limitations upon free speech
for American citizens in peacetime. Until we are actually at war
it is the right of every American to advocate, if he likes, that we
should ally ourselves with Germany and go to war against Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
Britain. The distinguishing characteristic of democracy is not
merely that the majority shall govern, but that the majority should
always give to the minority exactly the same rights and privileges
as the majority enjoys.</p>

<p>We often overlook the fact that this is the essential nature of
democracy. Rule by majority may obtain under any successful
dictatorship. Hitler undoubtedly has a strong majority of Germans
behind him and will probably continue to have it until he falls by
force from abroad. But that does not make his rule democratic. He
refuses to give the minority opposing him any rights whatever.
He considers it contemptible weakness of the democracies that
they should protect the rights of their minorities, and even of
minority groups who, if they were to come to power, would
abolish democracy.</p>

<p>Here is our central difficulty. We recognize that Lindbergh and
his followers, the Nazis and Fascists, as well as that other antidemocratic
group, the American Communists, would destroy
America as we know it if they were successful in their policies. Yet
if we suppress them for anything less than formally treasonable
acts, we shall have violated the most precious tenet of democracy.
Giving aid and comfort to the enemy in wartime is a formally
treasonable act, and we may take consolation in the fact that
Wheeler and Lindbergh and their lesser associates are not likely
to be able to continue after we have gone to war to render to
Hitler the aid and comfort they now render him. At this moment,
when we are not yet in a formal state of war, about the most
effective control that can be exercised over Lindbergh and his
associates is for the President to have identified him publicly as a
“Vallandigham,” and for others to do what they can to expose his
purposes.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why do you single out Lindbergh for special attention, since
there are many others of equal prominence who are also helping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
Hitler, such as ex-President Hoover, Senators Wheeler and Nye,
Congressman Fish, and so on?</em></p>

<p>A. No, they are not of equal prominence, not even the ex-President,
because Lindbergh had something that appealed so profoundly
to America that he has not lost it all yet, and he towers
in influence above our other isolationists, some of whom are
plainly patriotic but deluded citizens. Lindbergh, however, is, I
am convinced, mainly responsible for the long hesitation of this
country to go to war to defend its life. I do not intend to impugn
Lindbergh’s sincerity, but surely there is something wrong with a
man who declares as he does that we should not go to war, among
other reasons, because we are not united, then does his utmost to
disunite us still further.</p>

<p>Mayor La Guardia, in his capacity as Director of Civilian
Defense, pleaded at a mass meeting in Philadelphia for all Americans
not in agreement with the Administration’s foreign policy
not to do or say anything that might give aid or comfort to a
potential enemy. Exactly twenty-four hours later, stepping on
La Guardia’s heels, Lindbergh addressed another mass meeting in
Philadelphia and attacked the President of the United States in
terms so violent that they were widely interpreted as calling for a
revolution against the Administration.</p>

<p>It was that famous speech which he was compelled to retract
in part since it alarmed so many even of his followers. Mrs. Kathleen
Norris, the novelist, a prominent member of the America
First Committee, and present on the platform with Lindbergh, told
reporters that afternoon, in answer to a question, that she could
“swear that no member of the committee is mixed up with any
subversive activity.” “Subversive” means “tending to overthrow,
upset, or destroy,” which is precisely what Lindbergh’s speeches
attempt to do to the Administration of the United States.</p>

<p>None of the isolationist crowd can compare with Lindbergh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
in importance to the Fifth Column in America. From the point of
view of American national security and the future of this country
he is America’s Public Enemy Number One, because he was once
so incomparably America’s National Hero of Heroes, and some
American people still hope that now from their former idol, politically
unbranded, apparently disinterested, they can finally get
the truth and the light. For the most part, Americans do not realize
what has happened to their National Hero, although fortunately
throughout the country there is a deep-seated distrust of anyone
who has taken up an attitude so palpably favorable to the nation’s
enemies.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What is the reason for the divorce between Lindbergh and
the American people who used to worship him unanimously? The
crowds he has at America First rallies may number thousands&mdash;mostly
Nazis and their sympathizers, I take it&mdash;but Lindbergh used
to have 130,000,000 Americans cheering him.</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, what is it that has happened to Lindbergh to cause such
a radical change? In 1927 Coolidge called him “noble”; in 1941
Roosevelt said he was “not wanted.” What a contrast! I have just
finished reading for the first time Lindbergh’s book called <em>We</em>,
as he referred to himself and his airplane, the <em>Spirit of St. Louis</em>,
containing the story of his life and flight. It moves one to sadness
to look back and remember the way that world of long ago reacted
to the twenty-five-year-old American’s feat. Many of us
have forgotten that the flight itself became secondary to the world’s
intoxication over the event.</p>

<p>Lindbergh received a more spectacular ovation, attended by
more persons, who were more excited, in France, Belgium, England,
and the United States than had ever been given any human
being in the history of the world by any of the multitudes which
have welcomed conquerors and kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span></p>

<p>Consider the terms used by President Coolidge in referring to
Lindbergh; “this sincere and genuine exemplar of fine and noble
virtues”; “illustrious citizen”; “this genial, modest American youth
with the naturalness, the simplicity and the poise of true greatness”;
“this wholesome, earnest, fearless, courageous product of America.”
And as if this were not enough, Coolidge read off a list of
“some of his qualities noted by the Army officers who examined
him for promotion, as shown by reports in the files of the Militia
Bureau of the War Department:</p>

<p>“‘Intelligent,’ ‘industrious,’ ‘energetic,’ ‘dependable,’ ‘purposeful,’
‘alert,’ ‘quick of reaction,’ ‘serious,’ ‘deliberate,’ ‘stable,’ ‘efficient,’
‘frank,’ ‘modest,’ ‘congenial,’ ‘a man of good moral habits and
regular in all his business transactions.’”</p>

<p>And then President Coolidge went on to say that “One of his
officers expressed his belief that the young man ‘would successfully
complete everything he undertakes.’ This reads like a prophecy.”</p>

<p>Heaven protect the American people if Lindbergh succeeds in
his present undertaking, because he has undertaken now to keep
America from meeting her peril before it becomes overwhelming.
He wants us to wait until the only allies left in the world for us
are stricken down and we stand by ourselves to face a combination
of powers stronger than we and unappeasably resolved to destroy
us.</p>

<p>He has undertaken this task apparently as a sort of crusade. We
are assured that his father before him, Charles Lindbergh, Congressman
from Minnesota, also possessed the Lindbergh sincerity as he
declaimed throughout the last war against American participation.
We recognize sincerity, persistence, and courage as admirable qualities
when linked with a just cause, but the possession of them only
makes the matter worse when they are associated with a disastrous
and cynical policy.</p>

<p>You ask “cynical”? Yes, Hitler, for example is a sincere cynic,
and so is Lindbergh. His policy shamelessly declares we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
withdraw aid from Britain, coolly watch her fall, and then as
quickly as possible trade with Hitler and make what we can out
of the defeat of civilization. Lindbergh genuinely sees nothing to
be ashamed of in advocating such a policy, and that makes him
deserve the title “sincere.” It is nevertheless as cynical as any Nazi
could invent. We could stomach that if the cynicism were realistic.
It is not. This would-be smart policy has no more chance to succeed
than the would-be Machiavellian policy of Mussolini, who
has given the world its least appetizing sight of the war: the avowed
brute too feeble to be brutal.</p>

<p>Lindbergh’s personality is important to us all, since he has assumed
office as a member of what they would call in England “the
disloyal opposition,” and so it is not too minor a point to note that
of all the qualities he was ever credited with, the quality of generosity
is lacking. Witness his experience with France and England.
To France and the French people he owed the beginning of the
ovation which was to make his fame and fortune, and he acknowledged
his debt this way in <em>We</em>: “The whole-hearted welcome to
me&mdash;an American&mdash;touched me beyond any point that words can
express. I left France with a debt of gratitude which, though I
cannot repay it, I shall always remember.” That was the old Lindbergh,
or rather the young one, still unspoiled.</p>

<p>Thirteen years later, when France stood more in need of a
friend than ever in her long and troubled history; when a mere
gesture of American solidarity with her cause might have put
heart in her bewildered troops and kept the enemy at bay; when
the word of a Lindbergh could have been effective in the awakening
of American public opinion to our obligation not to let France
fall, for our own sake as well as for hers; Lindbergh spoke. He
spoke against America’s giving France any aid whatever. It was
May 20, 1940 and the Germans stood on the Somme. Lindbergh’s
broadcast summarized everything he has had to say since: “Years
ago we decided to stay out of foreign wars. We based our military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
policy on that decision. We must not waver now that the crisis is
at hand. There is no longer time for us to enter this war successfully.”</p>

<p>I was with the French at that time and can testify that Lindbergh’s
words struck France like a blow between the eyes. The
famous Lafayette Escadrille announced that it had deprived Lindbergh
of his honorary membership. Lindbergh’s response to England
was identical. He took his child to England after he had
suffered his great family tragedy in America, and in England
he received everything he desired: quiet hospitality and all the
privacy he has said he wanted. But when England stood with her
back to the wall, and once again the American attitude to the war
became decisive; and once again the voice of a Lindbergh could
have worked powerfully to shake our people into the tardy realization
that this time would be the last time and that if we did not
awaken now we might never be given the chance again; when our
people needed to realize that the fate of America was inextricably
bound up with the fate of Britain, and that if Britain fell our hopes
would all become forlorn; then Lindbergh spoke.</p>

<p>Now, he declared, we should cease to aid Britain in any manner,
because Britain was beaten, Germany had won, and we had better
make the best terms we could with the conqueror. With the total
lack of shame which characterizes Hitler’s and Lindbergh’s political
philosophy he declaimed in the same speech of June 16, 1940 that,
“Fortunately, the wide wall of the Atlantic stands between us and
the shooting that is going on.” It is, of course, the strong wall of
the British Navy that stands between us and the shooting that is
going on, but Lindbergh has never admitted that the British Navy
plays any role in keeping the Germans from crossing the Atlantic;
his implication is that the water of the Atlantic constitutes the sole
hindrance to German passage.</p>

<p>This incomprehension sometimes reaches a degree which is puzzling
to an observer convinced that “at any rate Lindbergh is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
sincere.” Some obviously honest Americans argue that we can
successfully hold aloof, but can any American really believe as
Lindbergh said in his speech at the opening of the war, September
16, 1939: “These wars in Europe are not wars in which civilization
is defending herself against some Asiatic intruder. There is no
Genghis Khan or Xerxes marching against our Western nations.
This is not a question of banding together to defend the white race
against foreign invasion. This is simply one more of those age-old
struggles within our family of nations.”</p>

<p>If Lindbergh believes this, he has failed utterly to understand
what Hitlerism is, or if he understands it, then he must approve of
it; and we surmised some months later with the publication of Anne
Lindbergh’s <cite>The Wave of the Future</cite>, that he was indeed a convert.
Surely it is not the color of Hitler’s skin and of his Nazi
warriors that make the difference, nor their geographic home.
Lindbergh implies that if they were yellow-skinned and came from
Tibet, he would understand and perhaps not oppose our fighting
them, but being white and living in Central Europe they cannot,
he implies, be enemies of civilization. This and other examples of
Lindbergh’s apparent naïveté, or as Raymond Clapper put it once,
his childishness, are not the result of an obtuse mind, but the consequence
of his having constantly to hide one element, the most
important element in his political attitude, and that is his secret
approval of the totalitarian idea and of the German Nazis’ right to
conquer.</p>

<p>This is too unpopular an idea to admit publicly now, and the
concealment of it leads to the most glaring discrepancies in his
arguments. Only a person who approved of Hitler could deny that
he is waging a war against civilization. Only Lindbergh can tell
how far he approves of Hitler’s right to conquer. We can observe
that in other countries, as France, men who talked before the defeat
as Lindbergh does now, were elevated to power in Hitler’s puppet
government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span></p>

<p>I was in England when Lindbergh delivered the first of his
broadcasts calling it “just another war,” and putting both belligerents
on the same level. The British were hurt. They felt that a
man whom they had considered a friend had let them down. They
did not know that he had never been a friend, but beneath a
serene, impenetrable demeanor had harbored an antipathy for
England which has contributed to making him “the way he is.”</p>

<p>This antipathy he has more than once documented, as in the
<cite>Collier’s</cite> article when he wrote the astounding sentence: “We in
America should not be discussing whether we will enter <em>the war
that England declared in Europe</em>.” Let those who set such store
by the quality of sincerity ask themselves if anyone on earth, including
a German, could <em>sincerely</em> define the present war as one
“that England declared in Europe.”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But you still have not explained why Lindbergh is the way he
is. You have only defined what he is.</em></p>

<p>A. Very well, but this is merely a personal interpretation of what
built his character and formed his motives. I believe in the importance
of emotional causes for most of men’s attitudes, and so
I should like to mention these causes first. The young Lindbergh,
as one can discover from <em>We</em>, seems really to have been possessed
of the virtues catalogued by President Coolidge. He became the
Lindbergh of today only after his flight. First came the initial
impact of the hysterical reaction of the world to his accomplishment.
It is bound to have affected him, and it did, despite the fact
that he appeared to the public as still the simple, modest, somewhat
shy boy who carried with him on his flight an introduction to the
American Ambassador to Paris.</p>

<p>It took the public a long time to learn otherwise, because from
the moment of his landing in Paris until only a comparatively
short time ago, Lindbergh was protected by the press of America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
in a way that could happen only in this youthful country of hero-worshipers.
When America has a hero, he remains a hero of purest
ray serene, and no flaw may be found in him, and if any are
privately discovered by newspaper reporters, or others, they are
carefully hidden. This is our standard behavior toward heroes, but
in the case of America’s hero of heroes the inhibitions voluntarily
imposed by the press upon itself were Spartan.</p>

<p>In newspaper parlance a sacred cow is an individual who for
reasons of policy must be protected from criticism. Every newspaper
has its sacred cows. Lindbergh became the Supreme Sacred
Cow of all the newspapers in America. Long after it became apparent
to the working newspapermen who came in contact with him
that he had succumbed to the adulation poured upon him and had
completely lost that original modesty which had endeared him to
the American public, perhaps above all his other qualities, and
that he had, in fact, become impatiently egotistic, and convinced
that he “knew it all,” he still was represented as the unassuming
young man who aspired only to be left alone. He complained that
the press would not let him alone, gave him no privacy, harassed
him. Publicity, he declared, he hated worse than anything in the
world. Newspapermen nevertheless observed that he and Greta
Garbo appeared to have the same technique, and that he managed
always to behave himself in such a way as to receive the greatest
amount of public attention.</p>

<p>The normal cycle of publicity received by a celebrity of the
type of Lindbergh was summed up by Sinclair Lewis. He and I
were standing at the bar in the Adlon Hotel in Berlin a few days
after Lindbergh landed in Paris, and the world had gone mad over
him. It seemed as though never had such adulation been poured
upon the head of any young man, and those who were not joining
in the almost universal blaze of hysterical feeling were curiously
examining the blaze, wondering what made the world go crazy.</p>

<p>Surely there had been more heroic exploits, even in the realm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
of aviation. The flight of Bleriot over the Channel in the primitive
machine at his disposal in 1909 has been estimated a more important
feat; while the flight of John Alcock and A. W. Brown from Newfoundland
to Ireland, June 14, 1919, although almost forgotten
in the din of Lindbergh’s ovation, was not only the first transoceanic
flight, but considering that it was made eight years before
Lindbergh’s with a machine correspondingly less modern, should
rank as a greater feat. All these things were subjects of discussion,
but Sinclair Lewis settled the matter by saying: “It doesn’t matter.
Lindbergh is the best-known man in the world today, but ten
years from now he will go into a hotel in Detroit and sign the
register, ‘Charles A. Lindbergh,’ and the room clerk will say ‘Lindbergh?
Yes, Mr. Lindbergh, Room 502. Boy! Show Mr. Lindbergh
his room,’ and the clerk won’t know him from Adam’s off ox.
That’s the way it is with fame. He has come by his with incredible
speed; it will go the same way.”</p>

<p>But it did not. Lindbergh saw to that by behaving so eccentrically
at times that even his mother-in-law, Mrs. Dwight Morrow,
has been heard to complain of it. I was in London at the time of
the birth of his baby there. Lindbergh for reasons of his own withheld
formal announcement of the birth until long after it had
taken place and the fact was known to so many persons that eventually
the newspapers, although with British reticence, carried the
report and queried Lindbergh to his great annoyance.</p>

<p>“I said to Charles,” Mrs. Morrow exclaimed to a friend, “if you
want to avoid being bothered by the press, why don’t you simply
announce the birth of your child? After all he’s normal and born
within wedlock.” Douglas Corrigan confirmed the judgment of
Lindbergh’s mother-in-law.</p>

<p>“Wrong-way Corrigan,” who flew to Ireland in the alleged
belief that he was flying to California, was a devoted disciple of
Lindbergh. I met Corrigan in Dublin shortly after he landed, and
I remember two things he told me which shed some light on Lindbergh’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
character. I was almost the first newspaperman to see Corrigan,
and in our introductory conversation the little Irish flyer,
whose flight in many ways was more remarkable than Lindbergh’s,
said: “I’m not going to do like Lindbergh and be hounded to death
by newspapermen. He refuses to see them and won’t say anything
for quotation and makes himself so mysterious that they never have
stopped going after him. If he had only opened up to them from
the very first and never refused to see them, very soon they would
have let him alone. That’s what I’m going to do&mdash;tell you anything
you want to know, and go on seeing anybody who wants to
see me, and pretty soon you will all get tired of it.”</p>

<p>Corrigan did just that and it all worked out exactly as he had
planned. He was soon left in peace and never suffered from Lindbergh’s
complaint. If Lindbergh had behaved as Corrigan did, there
never would have grown up between American newspapermen
and himself the secret feud that required all his prestige as national
hero to keep under cover. You may say that Corrigan’s flight could
not be compared to Lindbergh’s in its sensational appeal as the first
solo flight across the ocean. Yes, but in another way the obscure
little Irishman’s flight was the more audacious of the two. Lindbergh
had a plane specially constructed, the finest money could
buy. He had lavish financial backing, friends to help him at every
turn. Corrigan had nothing but his own ambition, courage, and
ability. His plane, a nine-year-old Curtis Robin, was the most
wretched-looking jalopy.</p>

<p>As I looked over it at the Dublin airdrome I really marveled that
anyone should have been rash enough even to go in the air with
it, much less try to fly the Atlantic. He built it, or rebuilt it, practically
as a boy would build a scooter out of a soapbox and a pair
of old roller skates. It looked it. The nose of the engine hood was
a mass of patches soldered by Corrigan himself into a crazy-quilt
design. The door behind which Corrigan crouched for twenty-eight
hours was fastened together with a piece of baling wire. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
reserve gasoline tanks put together by Corrigan, left him so little
room that he had to sit hunched forward with his knees cramped,
and not enough window space to see the ground when landing.
It had cost Corrigan $325, saved nickel by nickel.</p>

<p>The inspiration for all of Corrigan’s sacrifice was his hero worship
of Lindbergh. As a young mechanic Corrigan had helped build
the <em>Spirit of St. Louis</em> in the Ryan Airlines plant in San Diego, California,
and from that time on he had lived for but one ambition,
to emulate his hero. The older flyer had millions of admirers but
none could have been more fervent than the little mechanic who
once wrote, “It was often necessary to work till midnight on the
<em>Spirit of St. Louis</em> and then come back at eight the next morning,
but everyone was glad to do that as they all seemed to be inspired
by the fellow that the plane was being built for&mdash;Lindbergh.”</p>

<p>When Corrigan landed in Dublin, it was an event sufficiently
sensational, and the “wrong-way” aspect of it so eccentric, that the
world gave its attention and hundreds of cables and radiograms
poured into the American Legation where the Minister, John
Cudahy, had given Corrigan quarters. Every hour scores of congratulations
were reaching Corrigan but he was visibly unhappy.
I asked him what was the matter.</p>

<p>“No cable from Lindbergh,” Corrigan replied. “That was the
thing I wanted most of all. Maybe it will come later.” It never did
come. Lindbergh never found time nor inclination to send the
single word which would have meant more to Corrigan than all
the other applause and rewards he won. I have related this to friends
of Lindbergh and their answer was, “Typical.”</p>

<p>After the first uproar over Lindbergh’s greatest flight had subsided
somewhat, he made his good-will flights. His marriage to the
gifted Anne Morrow, daughter of the brilliant Morgan partner,
Dwight Morrow, linked him now with America’s greatest financial
house, and put the Swedish immigrant’s son definitely in the category
of those who have a stake to protect against social disturbance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
and the consequences of war. The fact that the marriage was
a love match, and that his wife had every quality of a distinguished
person and was a poet in her own right, helped establish Lindbergh
even more firmly in the affections of the American public. The
American feeling toward him had mellowed from hysterical hero
worship to what seemed to be a love which would endure.</p>

<p>Then came the heart-breaking tragedy of the kidnaping and
murder of his child. All fathers, all mothers, throughout the world
suffered with the Lindberghs. Years later during the Spanish Civil
War, when I was imprisoned by orders of the Gestapo in San
Sebastian, with me was a Spanish workman who that night was
taken from the cell and shot, and I remember how just before the
door opened and he was summoned by his executioners, he was discussing
the Lindbergh kidnaping.</p>

<p>The world-wide outpouring of sympathy with the Lindberghs
during that woeful period of their lives was surpassed only by the
intense, personal, national compassion of America for them in their
pain. Now Lindbergh had become no longer just the national hero,
but one for whom the nation felt the intimacy of suffering shared.
He responded by leaving the country with his family to quit the
scene of their sorrow, to find a sanctuary to heal their wounds, to
escape public attention, and to find a safety for his children he felt
he could not find in the United States.</p>

<p>This was the turning point of his relationship with his country.
His country was ready to forgive because it felt it could understand
his need for a refuge, but for Lindbergh his residence abroad
was a true renunciation of democratic America, and this I believe
to be the key to his subsequent political activity and his present
defiance of the vast majority of his fellow citizens.</p>

<p>He found his sought-for refuge in England where he was given
every consideration. The door of every home from Buckingham
Palace down was open to him, but the British afforded him all the
privacy he wanted. If it had been only privacy he sought, he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
have led a restful secluded life in the country home of Harold
Nicolson, his father-in-law’s biographer, and could have remained
at peace until Hitler disturbed it. Lindbergh spent just enough time
in England to convince him that England was soft, England
couldn’t take it, England would lose if it ever went to war. It was
bad luck that Lindbergh should have lived in England during a
time when it <em>was</em> soft, just as we are soft today. It was the England
of pacifism, faith in the principle that if you want peace badly
enough you can have it, just by refusing to fight. It was the England
of the Oxford Union when the debating society boys voted
not to fight “for King and Country.” It was the England which
needed waking up, just as we need it today. It was an England that
could get hard, if it had the time, just as we can get hard too, if we
have the time.</p>

<p>But Lindbergh formed his opinion of England then, and from
his public speeches he seems too stubborn to allow even the epic
heroism of England today in battle to change his judgment. Nicolson,
long-standing family friend of the Morrows, mailed Lindbergh
a postcard every week during the Battle of Britain, when the people
of England were persevering under a hurricane of bombs and were
calling it their “finest hour.” Each postcard had the one sentence:
“Do you still think we are soft?” Perhaps he still thinks so, long
after the Germans have stopped thinking so. At any rate, he left
England for a tour of the continent, and thereupon came the second
turning point in the development of his political views.</p>

<p>When he left America he left it embittered by the tragedy of
his child, and he left convinced that it would never have happened
except in a corrupt, gang-ridden democracy. It was, indeed, one
of the lowest periods in America’s public life, when kidnaping for
ransom had become widespread for the first time in any modern
civilized state, and the power of the gangs was a national humiliation.
In a sense it was true that it was the fault of democracy, but
the virtue of democracy is that slowly but almost always sooner or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
later we correct the faults and bring under control the license which
ever threatens democratic liberty. The Federal Bureau of Investigation,
however, had not grown up when Lindbergh fled America.</p>

<p>He visited many places on the continent, but the visits to Germany
and the Soviet Union were decisive. Here were crystallized
the political ideas which had been fermenting within him ever
since he felt the thrill that came with the first taste of power over
the throngs of Americans gathered to adore him. In Russia he found
the object of his political hatred: the poverty, squalor, dirt,
inefficiency, and cruelty of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. He
was treated well by the Bolshevik authorities, who as Russians
regarded him as an artist, a genius of the air, a man who, like a great
singer, could be considered outside of politics.</p>

<p>His political slate was up to that time blank. The Russians often
welcome foreign celebrities supposed to be without politics. They
gave Harpo Marx a cordial reception. Lindbergh was shown the
Red Army, its Air Corps, the aviation factories, and no doubt the
Bolsheviks thought he was impressed. A layman traveling through
Russia is shocked at the wretched state of the people, their poor
clothing, bad food, their brutal overcrowding. You may be sure
that this was not the prime object of Lindbergh’s attention. Lindbergh
is not interested in human beings. He is interested in machines.
In Russia he saw the poorest machine he had ever seen. He
observed that the ponderous Bolshevik society operated with an
unparalleled waste of man power and with unmatched inefficiency.
He saw the Soviet Air factories, and declared he detected the
slovenly workmanship which mars all Soviet production. He
reviewed portions of the Red Army Air Corps and registered his
opinion that most of the planes were obsolete or obsolescent.</p>

<p>In Nazi Germany Lindbergh found the object of his political
admiration, even affection, for here at last he had found the perfect
machine. Not only was it the antithesis in every material respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
of the Soviet Union, a streamlined, chromium-plated, eighteen-jewel
model of totalitarian clockwork, compared with the dilapidated
Soviet jalopy, but the Nazi machine also promised to banish
the Soviet menace from the face of the earth. Lindbergh had in
Germany first an aesthetic delight in the efficiency of the machine,
then a moral satisfaction in the thought that it would eradicate the
blot of Bolshevism.</p>

<p>Finally a personal consideration came to him. The kidnaping
and death of his baby could never have happened in Nazi Germany.
Common crime was almost unknown in Nazi Germany. He
failed to reflect that under the dictators crime is reserved as the
monopoly of the State, and that from any normal human standpoint
there is more crime committed in Nazi Germany in a year
than in America in ten years of its most besotted gangster period,
only in Germany it is all committed by the State. Lindbergh loved
Germany.</p>

<p>He saw the great Army, then in the last stages of readying itself
to spring upon Europe and set out to conquer the world. He saw
the great Luftwaffe, and Goering himself “surprised” him by pinning
the Service Cross of the Order of the German Eagle with Star
on his breast before he could help himself. Lindbergh has not yet
divested himself of his Nazi decoration. He laid down his commission
because he quarreled with the President of the United States,
but he has no quarrel with Hitler.</p>

<p>Lindbergh was so delighted with the whole atmosphere of this
perfectly functioning totalitarian machine that he was contemplating
making his residence in Berlin, where an American news agency
reported that the apartment of a Jew, liquidated in the monster
pogrom of November 1938, had been offered him. He stayed long
enough to become convinced that the Nazis were the wave, which,
whether we liked it or not, would eventually engulf the world.
Lindbergh liked it. Here were no democratic gangsterism, corruption,
private crime. Here were no Bolshevik slackness, squalor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
waste. Here was the New Order, of superior men, like himself, of
tall, blond, blue-eyed Aryans, like himself, of Nordics, like himself.
He felt among his own kind.</p>

<p>The Terror, the concentration camps, the murderous persecution
of the Jews and political opponents, the suppression of free speech,
of the press, of worship, even of thought and conscience! What of
it! This was only the scum on the wave of the future, and as for
the suppression of the press, <em>that</em> at least was no scum, that was
sheer progress. The literal enslavement of a whole population!
Well, they like it, don’t they? What of the fact that the entire machine
and every part of it was built for war, and for war which if
successful in Europe would eventually reach and thrust at the heart
of America? Nonsense, the Germans could whip Europe all right,
indeed Lindbergh declared his conviction they would, but they
intended no harm to America. He knew, because hadn’t they been
nice to him, an American? Anyway, he wouldn’t say anything
about it in public, but if the truth be known, America could go a
long way and do worse than by emulating some of the Nazis’ virtues.</p>

<p>Liberty? Bah, Lindbergh would take order and efficiency any
day ahead of liberty and inefficiency. Besides, Lindbergh was one
of the class of superior men, superior in talent, ability, and comprehension
of what society needs, who in a totalitarian state would
enjoy all the freedom he wanted since his ideas would conform
with those of the rulers and he would belong to the company of
masters of the New Order. He had nothing to fear from a Nazi
conquest.</p>

<p>With these thoughts in mind Lindbergh returned first to England
and told them they had better give up because the Russians were
no good and the Germans knew it, and the Germans were strong
enough to conquer all Europe, and the proof was in the air forces
he had just inspected. His advice was believed to have had something
to do with the disaster of Munich, when Britain and France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
convinced their cause was hopeless, lost a war without fighting it.
In every point of his argument Lindbergh had agreed with Hitler,
and in every point Lindbergh and Hitler were correct, save in one
point. They made a mistake about England.</p>

<p>When England recovered from the shock of Munich, she began
to throw off her weakness and get tough. But Lindbergh had left
for America. He did not have time to see England recover the manhood
which seemed lost when he was there. Lindbergh came home
now bursting with a message, eager to lead, anxious to play a political
role, and resolved as he has been all his life to be content with
nothing less than the greatest role. “Lindbergh will be the next
President of the United States. He is our man.” So said the Belgian
friend of the Nazis. The British Lindbergh, Oswald Mosley, leader
of the British Union of Fascists, is on the political bottom; he is in
Brixton prison. Mosley is no less sincere a man than Lindbergh.
Vidkun Quisling is on the political top; he is Hitler’s man in Norway.
The political future of Lindbergh will obviously depend
largely upon whether Germany or our side wins the war.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Why did Lindbergh attack the Jews?</em></p>

<p>A. Because anti-Semitism is an integral part of Hitlerism. If you
are not against Hitler you are for him, and if you are for Hitler you
will be compelled, sooner or later, and whether you intend it or
not, to become an anti-Semite. Every country now under Hitler’s
heel has officially sponsored and promoted anti-Semitism. It was
easy to read Lindbergh’s anti-Semitism between the lines of his
references to the “foreign” influences at work in America. He
waited only until he thought the time ripe for his public announcement,
but the results proved his calculation wrong. His statement
against the Jews brought a roar of repudiation from all creeds and
classes of the nation, and the only approval came from the group
around Lindbergh who constitute what might be called the America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
First’s Quisling Committee. Lindbergh’s anti-Semitism could be
sufficiently explained on the ground of temperament. He admires,
he understands, and loves only machines and he could hardly be
expected to understand or appreciate, much less approve, the
spiritual values which for thousands of years have upheld the Jews
through adversities which would have annihilated scores of more
numerous but less faithful communities.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What is to be the fate of the Jews?</em></p>

<p>A. If Hitler’s power is not destroyed, if Hitler were to win, all
Jews under his domination would be condemned to slow death.
Why slow? Why doesn’t Hitler kill them all at once? Because he
enjoys watching them suffer, has a sadistic pleasure in it; because
he needs their labor power for the menial tasks to which he assigns
them; and because he probably feels that until he conquers the
whole world it would be wiser not to outrage what there is left
of world opinion.</p>

<p>Besides, Hitler finds the Jews useful wherever he wishes to divide
a conquered population, as in France where the hostages he shoots
are for the most part called Jews or Communists. Every time he
shoots a Jewish hostage he says to the non-Jews, “You see, if it
were not for your Jews, you and I could get along perfectly
together!” By this device of making the Jew the scapegoat, he
works to arouse anti-Semitism among the vanquished and anti-Semitism
in any form anywhere is the most faithful handmaid of
Hitlerism.</p>

<p>Therefore, he has not completely eliminated the Jews from any
part of his territories, but has allowed to remain, under conditions
of the most abject servitude, 200,000 out of the original 660,000
in Germany proper; 40,000 out of the original 190,000 in Austria;
100,000 out of 380,000 in Czechoslovakia; 20,000 out of 156,000
in Holland; 30,000 out of 63,000 in Belgium; an estimated 380,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
native and foreign Jews in France, occupied and unoccupied;
750,000 in Hungary, including everyone with one-quarter Jewish
blood; 300,000 in truncated Rumania; 97,000 in Latvia; 177,000 in
Lithuania; 5,000 in Esthonia; and 100,000 in Greece. These figures
are cited by <cite>The American Hebrew</cite>. Poland must come in a separate
category since there Hitler has apparently set out to exterminate
the 3,000,000 Jews without the restraint he seems to have put
on himself elsewhere.</p>

<p>Nobody knows how many of the Polish Jews have died; their
fate is only more dreadful than that inflicted upon the entire Polish
population. Sober observers believe that twenty per cent of the
Polish population as a whole have been killed or have died as a
result of the two years of German and Russian occupation. If this
is true, then of the 6,000,000 dead, one must reckon that at least
1,000,000 are Jews. Whether this figure is too high or too low, the
obvious intent of the Germans in Poland is to wipe out the Jews
altogether, and the wonder is that any at all are living today.</p>

<p>In Soviet Russia the 5,000,000 Jews are not subject to any
official discrimination, but suffer as the rest of the population from
the generally wretched conditions of life aggravated by the war.
These conditions of life in the Soviet Union would be intolerable
under normal circumstances, especially since the Jews, like other
faiths, have been deprived of the facilities formally to practice their
religion, but now that Europe under the Nazis has become a charnel
house for Jews, the Soviet Union must seem like a haven of refuge.
There seems to be no alternative for the Jews except that they
suffer death at the hands of Hitlerism, or that Hitlerism be destroyed.
It can be destroyed better with the outspoken, avowed
help of the Jews of the world, and especially the Jews of America.</p>

<p>It is shocking, indeed, to observe the names of a few Jews on
isolationist committees, and one wonders what mental processes
have brought them there. Do they imagine that if America remains
aloof and Hitler wins the rest of the world, that the Jews, or any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
other Americans, will be safe? No, if Hitler wins the rest of the
world, the Lindberghs of America will boldly put their anti-Semitism
to work, and the fate of the Jews in America will approximate
that of their brothers abroad. There is no choice for the Jews of
America but to put all the strength of their bodies and souls and
purses to work against the enemy of all mankind. There is no reason
for them to apologize for fighting the universal scourge. The anti-Semite
is a friend of Hitler. The friend of Hitler is the enemy of
the United States.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>I would like to read you a passage from a speech of Lindbergh
delivered shortly after the German invasion of Russia, and ask you
what you think of it, as it is quite confusing to me. The passage
reads: “The longer this war in Europe continues, the more confused
its issues become. When it started Germany and Russia were
lined up against England and France. Now, less than two years
later we find Russia and England fighting France and Germany.
Winter before last, when Russia was fighting Finland, the interventionists
demanded that we send all possible aid to Finland.
Now, when Russia is fighting Finland again they demand that we
send all possible aid to Russia.... Finland and France are now
our enemies; Russia our friend. We have been asked to defend the
English way of life, and the Chinese way of life. We are now
asked to defend the Russian way of life.... Judging from
Europe’s record, if we enter this war, we can’t be sure whether we
will have Germany or Russia for a partner by the time we finish
it. We don’t even know whether we will end up with France or
England on our side. It is quite possible that we would find ourselves
alone fighting the entire world before it was over.”</em></p>

<p>A. The confusion is of Lindbergh’s own making. There is a simple
key to all the apparent contradictions he brings out. The key is
that Hitler Germany was, is, and will remain the enemy until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
Hitlerism is destroyed. The correct way to express the relationships
which Lindbergh has put so confusingly is: All nations fighting
Germany are fighting on our side; all nations fighting on the
side of Germany are fighting against us. When a nation, for any
reason, switches sides, for or against Germany, it automatically
switches sides for or against us. The question of friendship, of
liking for any of these nations, or of approval of their “way of
life” does not decide the matter. The matter is decided solely by
the effect the particular nation is having on Germany’s war.</p>

<p>Let us examine each of Lindbergh’s statements in turn. He says
the longer the war continues, the more confused its issues become.
Not at all&mdash;the longer it lasts the more plain it becomes that the
issue is: Germany against the world. Do not be confused by the
fact that some countries which were fighting Germany, now come
out on Germany’s side. As Germany conquers one country after
another, she attempts to force them into fighting for her, as in the
case of France. No matter what Hitler’s puppet government in
France does, we know that the true France is no friend of Germany,
but an implacable enemy. Napoleon at one time had half a
dozen armies raised from among the peoples he had conquered,
marching under his banners. But the moment Napoleon suffered
reverses, they revolted. So it will be with Hitler.</p>

<p>Finland’s position is easy to understand if you reflect that she
was so much subject to Hitler’s coercion that she had to behave
almost as though she too had been conquered. It would have been
suicide if Finland, resisting Germany’s demands that she join the
German side, should have had to fight both the German and the
Russian armies. That way Poland was torn to pieces. It would
have been unthinkable that Finland, so recently mutilated by
Russia, should have admitted the Red Army to her territories. It
was inevitable that Finland should choose the lesser of two evils.
And so we, understanding Finland’s plight, must classify her on
Germany’s side and embargo goods to her. But we can still think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
of her as a friend, and only as a technical enemy by force of circumstances.</p>

<p>The position of Russia is equally clear. Bolshevik Russia, the
Soviet Union, is nobody’s friend, and never pretended to be. She,
like Germany, is “against the world,” and by making the pact with
Germany at the beginning of the war she expected to see the
world eventually collapse and become her loot. Now that Germany
has forced Russia to fight, Russia should enjoy every material
aid we can give her. As long as she continues to fight Germany,
we should do all we can to help her blows injure our enemy. So it
is only in order to confuse us that Lindbergh phrases it the way he
does: “Finland and France are now our enemies; Russia our
friend.”</p>

<p>Lindbergh says we are asked to defend the English, the Chinese,
and now the Russian way of life. It would not make any difference
to us if the English, the Chinese, and the Russians lived like lizards,
crocodiles, and alligators, so long as they were aiding directly and
willingly as the British, or directly though unwillingly, as the
Russians, or indirectly as the Chinese, to protect us by opposing
our enemies. We are only helping ourselves when we help them.</p>

<p>Lindbergh ends: “It is quite possible that we would find ourselves
alone fighting the entire world before it was over.” No, it is
not just “quite possible,” it is absolutely certain that we will find
ourselves fighting the entire world if we do not intervene to save
some part of the world to fight on our side.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>In one of Lindbergh’s speeches he made the statement that “the
only reason we are in danger of becoming involved in this war is
because there are powerful elements who desire us to take a part.”
Is this true?</em></p>

<p>A. There are powerful elements who desire us to take part, namely
all the intelligent patriotic Americans who wish to defend their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
country while there is yet time, but that is not what Lindbergh
meant. He is using veiled language to express what his admirers,
the Nazi Bundists, the Fascists, and the Kluxers say openly when
they charge that America is being “driven into war by the Jews,
the international bankers, and the armaments manufacturers.” It is
a rule of the politics of this era, as Alexander Woollcott pointed
out, that if you are not against Hitler, you are for him, and sooner
or later, willingly or unwillingly you become lined up for all the
things he stands for, some of which you may not have wished to
embrace, as racial hatred, anti-Semitism, and the rule of the man
with the gun.</p>

<p>The rich men in the America First Committee of Lindbergh and
General Wood, fancy they are protecting their investments by
lining up against beating Hitler, but if they permit him to win they
will lose their wealth as surely as if they had helped run up the
Red Flag.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>Can you give us a brief, objective resumé of Lindbergh’s argument
against our entering the war?</em></p>

<p>A. Yes, he has set it forth very clearly in his “Letter to America”
published in <cite>Collier’s</cite> magazine, where his principal ideas are
summed up, without any omission save the fact of his contempt for
the democracies and his admiration for the totalitarian system. It
runs as follows: England and France have only themselves to blame
for their defeat. (He takes for granted that England is defeated.)
First, because they did not make a reasonable adjustment with Germany
while there was still time. Second, because they made the
Versailles treaty too harsh to appease Germany and too lenient to
hold her down. Third, because when Germany rose under Hitler
they did not take advantage of the last chance to stop him when
they could, at his reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936. They
were always too late, and now we in America are too late to stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
him. We are unarmed and unable to fight. We have not as many
thoroughly modern fighting planes in our Army and Navy combined
as Germany produces in a single week. “If we enter the war
now, it would mean humiliation and defeat.” It is impossible for us
to invade Europe. On the other hand, it is impossible for Germany
to invade us. They cannot invade us by air over Greenland because
it is too cold, nor by way of South America because it is too far,
and the South Americans with our aid could prevent them from
constructing landing fields. We can stay out of the war, make ourselves
impregnable, and afterward force other nations to trade with
us. That should be our policy.</p>

<p>Counterattacking, he demands to know if we enter the war,
first, how are we to defeat Germany? Second, how are we to
“impose our ideology” on our enemies? Third, what would it cost
to win the war in American lives and how long would the war
last? Fourth, what are our war aims? But he always comes back to
the question: “How could we win the war if we entered it?”</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>How can we win?</em></p>

<p>A. I have an answer. There are too many surprises in warfare&mdash;witness
the German attack on Russia&mdash;for anyone, including the
military experts, to be sure of anything, and I am not a military
expert. But I should like to preface my reply to Lindbergh’s whole
argument by remarking that he assumes we have a choice in the
matter, and that we can avoid going to war if we want to. I do not
believe we have any choice except in the matter of timing. I should
like to ask Lindbergh if he believes that by adopting his complete
program, even withdrawal of all aid to Britain, thus insuring British
defeat, we could thereby induce Hitler to grant us better terms?
Leaving aside all national honor and pride, suppose we were to
switch our policy completely and not only abandoned Britain but
like Vichy France made clandestine war upon her, or openly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
stabbed her in the back with a declaration of war à la Mussolini.
Even in that case can anyone believe we would receive any better
treatment than Hitler has in store for Vichy France or his ally
Italy? It is plain that all we should gain by such conduct would
be an increase in the unbounded contempt he already has for us.</p>

<p>We have not the choice of war or isolation. We have only the
choice of war or surrender.</p>

<p>Let us take his points one by one. First, that England and France
have only themselves to blame for their defeat. But England is not
defeated, and I am convinced that she can be defeated only by our
defection on the lines advocated by Lindbergh. She was to blame
for her refusal to see her danger in time, and for the same reason
France was to blame for her defeat. I agree to this, but to waste
time now in such recriminations is folly. Lindbergh says England
and France were always too late and that now we in America are
too late to save England. But it is our Lindberghs who are making
us late. We are still not armed, agreed, but how can we win the
time to arm? We can gain the time to arm only by upholding
Britain, keeping her fighting, and keeping the Germans out of
control of the Atlantic. We can do that now by going to war with
Germany and reinforcing Britain with all the force at our disposal,
which is adequate when ranged beside the present strength of
Britain but inadequate to fight alone. Only our entry into the war
now, before it is too late, can guarantee that Britain stands, and as
long as Britain stands we can build our arms in perfect security
until the combined British and American might is strong enough
to defeat Germany. Lindbergh’s argument is that if we fight beside
Britain now we lose; if we fight alone later, we win.</p>

<p>He says we cannot be invaded: “I believe that we can build a
military and commercial position on this continent that is impregnable
to attack.” But in the preceding paragraph he says that for
us to win a war we must prepare for it “not for one year, or for
two, but for ten years or for twenty as Germany has done.” Does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
he imagine that Hitler would give us twenty years to prepare for
war, or ten, or two, or even one after he had beaten Britain?</p>

<p>But they cannot get at us, says Lindbergh, citing the difficulty
of air-borne invasion by Greenland or South America. Nobody
imagines an exclusively air-borne invasion of America is possible.
But if the British lose the war before we complete our two-ocean
navy in 1947, sea power goes to the Germans. Lindbergh at no
time discussed this all-important fact. Nor the fact that a defeated
Britain, like defeated France, would be yoked into the Nazi war
machine to be used against the last enemy, ourselves. Does he really
believe that if this happens within the next year or eighteen
months, much less in shorter time, we shall be able alone to repel
a German attack on this hemisphere, an attack supported by all the
navies and warplanes left on earth except our own? We have
already set forth the fact that after conquest of Britain Germany
would possess shipping to transport millions, twenty to thirty
thousand tanks, five or six times the number of warplanes we shall
be able to produce in eighteen months, and the most formidable
army the world has ever seen, driven by the indomitable will of
Hitler to conquer the globe or die.</p>

<p>Leave aside, though, the possibility of direct invasion of the continental
United States, and let us discuss with Lindbergh the possibility
of German invasion of South America. He declares this, too,
would be impossible “in opposition to the armed forces of Brazil
backed by our own Army, Navy and Air Corps.” But it is 4,258
miles from New York to Pernambuco, Brazil, the place nearest to
us where the Germans might want to land, while it is only 3,847
miles from New York to London. Lindbergh advocates that we
should attempt to defend Pernambuco though it is 400 miles
farther from New York than London, which he says we should
not defend because, among other things, of the difficulty of sending
an expeditionary force so far. Does Lindbergh truly think
Pernambuco easier and more worth while for us to defend than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
London? Does he really believe after Germany had conquered
Europe and Britain that Brazil or any other South American state
would oppose Germany or invite us to help it fight Germany?</p>

<p>But he demands to know, how can we defeat Germany if we do
go to war? He knows the answer to that better than anyone. We
can defeat Germany only by obtaining mastery of the air over
Germany, then destroying the German air force; once the Luftwaffe
is destroyed, the impact of that blow alone may cause the
first crack in the military and civilian morale of Germany and lift
the morale of the conquered peoples to aid in expelling their conquerors.
Let me reiterate that the conquered peoples will never
revolt until they see the possibility of successful revolt and that
will come only with the first serious military setback of the Germans.</p>

<p>Would we have to send an expeditionary land army? We probably
shall have to send our best units, and do it quickly, to prevent
German seizure of the West African ports and islands affording
springboards to America. Our troops would be useful now in
North Africa and the Near East. Wherever contact with the
enemy can be had, we should be represented as strongly as possible.
It is also likely that we shall need to send an A.E.F. to the
continent, although not necessarily as large as in the last war. If we
can get air superiority, it will mean the war is practically won. I
should expect Germany then to crack up.</p>

<p>Even if she did not break down at once, the demoralization
entailed by loss of control of the air would be so great that landings
on the continent should be feasible at almost any place the
Allies chose. Lindbergh persistently asks where we could land an
expeditionary force. The answer is that if we get there in time we
shall have an excellent base of operations across the seas, Great
Britain. From there the coast of Nazi Europe presents hundreds of
opportunities for invasion, once the Nazi air force is eliminated.</p>

<p>Lindbergh demands to know how long it would take to win if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
we think, contrary to his judgment, that we can win. I should
think it would take a minimum of three years after we enter the
war, maybe four, possibly five or six. It can be accomplished only
by expanding our present aircraft production program, which has
orders now for 80,000 planes, to whatever dimensions prove necessary.
This depends on how many planes the Germans are able to
produce from their own and conquered factories, including all the
facilities of their conquests in the East. We shall certainly have to
think in terms of hundreds of thousands of planes. We and the
British will have to supply the pilots and crews and ground crews
for these planes, and it may be that our Air Corps will number
upwards of a million before we are through. We have the men and
the machines to do it.</p>

<p>“How much would it cost in American lives?” Lindbergh
demands. Who can tell? We know only that until the Germans
went into Russia the casualties in this war had been inconsiderable
compared with the last war. As long as combat was confined to the
air and the sea, the numbers of combatant lives lost were in the
thousands compared with the hundreds of thousands of soldier
lives lost in comparable periods in the land fighting of the last war.
The bombardment of civilians has been ghastly, but the number
of lives lost has been on the whole surprisingly small&mdash;41,900 persons
killed in Britain from January 1940 to June 1941. It has even
been asserted that in Britain, despite the hardships, war has so
elevated the tone, the spirit of the population, that death by disease
has declined until the gain has made up for the loss of life by
bombardment. The relatively small number of deaths is explained
by Mr. Churchill as the result of air raid precautions. After the
bloodiest month of the Battle of Britain, September 1940, Mr.
Churchill made a remarkable analysis.</p>

<p>“We are told,” he said, “by the Germans that 251 tons of explosives
were thrown upon London in a single night, that is to say,
only a few tons less than the total dropped on the whole country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
throughout the last war. Now we know exactly what our casualties
have been. On that particular Thursday night 180 persons
were killed in London as a result of 251 tons of bombs. That is to
say it took one ton of bombs to kill three-quarters of a person. We
know, of course, exactly the ratio of loss in the last war, because
all the facts were ascertained after it was over. In that war the
small bombs of early patterns which were used killed ten persons
for every ton discharged in the built-up areas. That is, the mortality
is now less than one-tenth of the mortality attaching to the
German bombing attacks in the last war....</p>

<p>“What is the explanation? There can only be one, namely the
vastly improved methods of shelter which have been adopted....
Whereas when we entered this war at the call of duty and honor
we expected to sustain losses which would amount to 3,000 killed
in a single night and 12,000 wounded, night after night, and made
hospital arrangements on the basis of a quarter of a million casualties
merely as a first provision; whereas that is what we did at the
beginning of the war, we have actually had since it began, up to
last Saturday, as a result of air bombing, about 8,500 killed and
13,000 wounded.” This was after three months of the Blitz; today
with the figure of 41,900 as the total dead, the Prime Minister’s
point is all the stronger as he concluded: “This shows that things
do not always turn out as badly as one expects.” Mr. Churchill
might have been speaking directly to Lindbergh.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But if air bombardment is as ineffective as these figures of
Churchill indicate, how do you expect us to be able to beat Germany
by winning air superiority and destroying the German air
force? Isn’t there a discrepancy in your argument?</em></p>

<p>A. No, because Britain has come off so lightly precisely because
the Germans never have gotten air supremacy over Britain. If they
ever did, it would mean they would win the war, just as if we ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
get air supremacy over Germany, it will mean that we will win the
war. Air supremacy means you can come over in the daytime, and
bomb with precision. Antiaircraft guns are unable to prevent
bombing. If there are no fighters to beat off the bombers, the
bombers can do just about as they like. They can dive-bomb and
destroy any objective they choose with about ninety per cent
accuracy. If the Luftwaffe is ever destroyed, British and American
planes can annihilate the entire German war industry and then
what will it avail Hitler to be the conqueror of all Europe, or of
Asia, too?</p>

<p>The R.A.F. has never been out to bomb civilians. The Germans
have proved how useless civilian bombing is against a brave people.
The R.A.F. has preferred the more difficult job of bombing military
objectives and already it has affected the Reich’s war-making
capacity. British bombs on the invasion ports had much to do with
Hitler’s postponement of his trip to England. With the addition to
the R.A.F. of hundreds of thousands of American machines, and
with our own hundreds of thousands in the American Air Force,
there is no reason to doubt that eventually the German military
apparatus can be smashed.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>What damage have the Germans done to the British war
machine; or to the buildings of London? Lindbergh insists Britain
is already beaten to her knees.</em></p>

<p>A. Exactly! Well, you have seen the loss of civilian life, amazingly
small. Now Mr. Churchill has given us an interesting estimate on
the damage to London. He said: “Statisticians may amuse themselves
by calculating that after making allowance for the working
of the law of diminishing returns, through the same house being
struck twice or three times over, it would take ten years at the
present rate, for half of the houses of London to be demolished.
After that, of course, progress would be much slower. Quite a lot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
of things are going to happen to Herr Hitler and the Nazi regime
before ten years are up.... Neither by material damage nor by
slaughter will the people of the British Empire be turned from
their solemn and inexorable purpose.” Does Lindbergh really think
the British are beaten?</p>

<p>But you may object, surely we shall not have to suffer bombing
of our civilian population. No, not if we enter the war in time to
keep it on the other side of the ocean. The oddest thing of all
about the Lindbergh policy is that it would wait for the war to
come to us, so that the bombs should fall on our homes, not on the
homes of our enemies. He represents precisely the fatal “Maginot
line policy” which he so decries in the French. He advises us to
sit behind our Maginot Atlantic and dream of our security until
the Germans break through.</p>

<p>Finally Lindbergh demands that we “define our war aims,” and
tell “how we are to impose our ideology on Germany, Russia,
Italy and Japan.” We do not wish to “impose our ideology” on
anyone. All we wish at the moment is to preserve our nation, keep
from becoming slaves of the Nazis, and prevent Hitler from imposing
his ideology upon us. We want only to make the world safe
for the United States, which means also for the friends and allies
of the United States, and if victory is ours we shall attempt to
include in the circle of security all the nations of good will on
earth. If this means “policing the earth,” let it mean that. The first
step to organize common security was taken when men agreed to
have a police force and for it sacrificed their individual right to
exercise individual justice, and agreed to pay taxes for the protection.
We are just now vigilantes trying to rid the community of
bandits.</p>

<p>It is a troublesome matter and after it is settled we may have
sense enough to organize at least for transient tranquillity and hope
against hope that education may help us to permanent peace. I
have not much hope of that myself, but if we, the United States of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
America, were to put our heart into the effort, I would have hope.
Unless we do there is no hope at all.</p>


<p class="qu">Q. <em>But how many lives could it cost America?</em></p>

<p>A. Nobody can say how many lives it will cost us to preserve
our liberty and independence. Maybe surprisingly few, maybe
heart-breakingly many. But is this a matter for bargaining? Does
Lindbergh ask us to say: “We, the United States of America will
give so and so many American lives in order to preserve our national
independence, our institutions, our children’s lives and our
liberty, but we will give so many and no more? If it costs more, we
will surrender! If it takes two years to win, we will make the trade;
if it costs ten, we give in!” If that is our attitude, we are beaten
before we begin. It is not America’s attitude. It was Vallandigham’s,
but not America’s.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
